The Two Pointer Technique is a common algorithmic strategy used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists,
especially when the input is sorted or when you're trying to find pairs or subarrays that meet certain conditions.


üîç What is the Two Pointer Technique?
    It involves using two indices (or "pointers") that iterate through the data structure in a coordinated way. The most common types:
        Start-End (Opposite Ends): One pointer starts from the beginning, and the other from the end. They move toward each other.
        Sliding Window (Same Direction): Both pointers start from the beginning and move forward, often used to track a range/subarray.

‚úÖ When to Use Two Pointers
    Sorted arrays where you're looking for pairs/sums
    Removing duplicates
    Reversing arrays
    Palindrome checking
    Partitioning
    Subarrays or substring problems (with conditions like max sum, length, etc.)
