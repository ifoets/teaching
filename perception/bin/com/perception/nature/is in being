Is IN Being(IBN)/Streaming
=====================================
Is in being(INB) is not the principle of nature but it is itself the nature. It is not the principle of Time or Space
but the existence of INB is in presence of Time & Space.

Each and every molecules,particles,waves,bounds,objects,tenors,thoughts,
feelings,lives,situations,understandings,realizations,
perceptions,actions,reactions,stars,mind,body,intellect,wishes,expectations,tensions,delights..so on...or whatever the things known or unknown but they are in under the process of INB.
In other words one can say INB is nothing but the transformation itself.
or one can say INB is nothing but the nature of streaming.

***There are infinite number of transformation process happen in single nano seconds***

If molecule tends to transformation means there are many transformation happen in there before tending to transform too.

One can realize the planets are in universe maintain some order,No not at all but these look like in some order
since we look the objects are in same situation from long time and realize they are in some order.
Every planets and their rotation are in INB only since every planets and their bounds made 
by molecule/particles/waves or what ever the material but theses all materials are in under 
streaming and hence the object obvious are in streaming.

***One realize object not the energy in the form of stream***

you can divert the flow of energy by your limited power but you cant touch the streaming(INB);
Since not only your existence but but also whatever you perform they all are in INB always.

***Neither INB follow any order nor follow any disorder****
***INB is non stoppable process***
