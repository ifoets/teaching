Imprecate(‡§ï‡•ã‡§∏‡§®‡§æ)
============================================
It is not the nature of self/observer. It is the nature of mind that defined the things in their own limited framework.
It the mind who look towards others as like here is the office for giving the credit for their employee.

This is different from comment, comment may improve some since it is open but to Imprecate always in suppress in it own state. It just create irritation in self life.

The birth of imprecate nature
-------------------------------------------------
The one who realize they are under many circumference and the circumference is under control of others.
They realize,They cant touch the circumference but if some one increase or decrease the circumference it affect them.
In that situation they realize their hand is not open for do something but their visualization is open to imprecate them who control the circumference.

It is obvious, if one gating in hindrance with others action and one can't do anything, then one can at least imprecate to them.
---------------------
This is nothing but our expectation from others since we look their action in our limited framework.

This is a type of irritation nothing else because of own poor perception only.

In day to day life if one observe the circumstance, it is simple to observe the nature of mind who imprecate many.

Ex- Abusing to leader, Abusing to teacher, Abusing to social activities, Abusing to culture, Abusing to nature, Abusing to Abusing , Abusing to master, to Imprecate relative,to imprecate honor. to imprecate society.....
so on...ie from where one realize the hindrance comes to them.

Without effective involvement in others action none can observe their situation/friction/complexity/uncertainty/hindrance..etc during the instance they perform action.
***If X imprecate Ys, Zs imprecate X  known or unknown***
***Many to Many relation here***
***Hindrance is our own creation within***
