The noon of life/A sate of noon in life
=======================================
Every process have a mid point during transformation of object/energy.
At mid point of transformation we realize the object gating transform.

Ex-
When we supply heat to ice, first the heat supply to abstract energy of ice to break their innermost bounds of atoms/molecules,
After certain time a moment come when we look ice becoming water. This is nothing but the noon of ice to become water.

Our feeling/understanding/realization/perception..etc also have also a noon after that 
the same feeling/... etc gives different meaning of same things.

Similar way there is also a noon in our life when our inner life and life start interaction.
There are infinite known or unknown ways life realize their noon during living the external life.
From which direction it comes in life we don't know since it is totally depends on inner life execution.
but a thin layer of inner life always is in touch with life and energy move back and forth with that thin layer.

These are many process that realize the noon in life.
Ex-
practicing meditation from log time, yogic kriya from long time, in silence from long time, in frustration from long time, in under self observation from long time,
serving from depth of heart from long time,destroying others life from long time,achieved the highest goal of your life but even feel unsatisfied.travelling from longtime,waiting from long time. Living alone from long time.
Heating from long time,suddenly get high intensity spark, many human died in front of you, sudden very high heart so on..etc 
The long time in above example is nothing but the process of
supplying energy to the abstract sleeping mode of realization.

Just before life realize its noon, internally all most all the abstract transformation already happen.
It look like an event in life but this is resultant of uncountable no of events.

***After noon of life, life itself comes in welcome back mode***
