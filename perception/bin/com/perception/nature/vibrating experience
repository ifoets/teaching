Vibrating Experience
==============================================================
Whatever one get/learn/observe..so on during some action/event/trek/feeling/understanding/perception/observation..so on, is nothing but the one's experience.
In other words one get something little or more when one involve personally in some activity is nothing but the experience.
Every one have the power of observation little or more depends up on their area/range of interest.With the higher power of observation one get higher experience ie the intensity of observation is dense.
One's experience is the streaming of their intelligence system.
Every lives have different frequency of observation and hence they all observe differently, These observation may be common at some point/area but it cant completely match with another.

              ***Experience is most valuable stuff***

Why one's experience vibrate?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Not only the experience but also anything one throw in relative state, it get confuse. 
It is just like one measure the distance of some point from many different origin and try to mach all the distances.One forget the basic measuring concept(origin is a center).

Why one throw experience in relative world?
---------------------------
If one not satisfy from their experience or their experience not work well in their life properly.
Then one try to satisfy by some different(other pathway) ways keep these experience in center and throws in relative wold.
If one find the similarity with other's experiences they get satisfaction, if not the get more confusion.
 
***Vibrating experience make fluctuation in confidence****
***Confidence itself a fluctuating state of experience****

Every one's experiences have frequency and hence there is some vibration, it may be little or more depends up on suspicion. The vibration come in count when it come out in the form of some query.

***Your experience is yours only, uniqueness is its nature***
