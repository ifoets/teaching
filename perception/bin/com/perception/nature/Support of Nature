Concept behind spherical support of Nature
=======================================
It can be observe what ever you want more or less nature provide you with process of some action. This support by nature is spherical that means it support you from infinite direction towards the center of sphere(your action).

You can realize, Nature not support each and every moment but it mostly support at critical situation. That means the object/situation/believe/eye/energy/...so on ..turn towards your action.
That's why it says that Nature is the best friend of lives.

Ex-
-If you want to create haven for your life, Nature support you to create it.
-If you want to create hell for your life ,Nature support you to create it.
-If you want create peaceful environment, Nature support you to create it.
-If you want to cheat your self , Nature support you to cheat.
-If you want to do meditation/yoga/silence/observer..so on, Nature support you to become.
-If you want to suicide, Nature support you to do the same. 

It means whatever one want and do action for that, Nature clear the path and the trouble/problem around it.
It means Nature is most flexible and supportive in nature for lives.

But the above statements are a example poor observation/understanding, it is not like that. Nature don't have any emotion, it cant support any one and it cant oppose any one.

****Nature follows streaming only***
***Neither nature support nor oppose lives**** 

Concept behind natural support
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 First of one should know, when any one want to do something and if the convert their energy into action towards fulfill of wishes.
Following stuff are activated in human brain.

-Their thought/emotion circulate towards the completion of action ie mean reaching to wishes.
-Their attention circulate towards the action and due to the attention flow towards particular direction, the energy activate towards the attention in their body/mind/blood/thought/emotion/brain..so on.
-Their arrangement/plane circulate towards the particular action
-They find the time and space for their action/wishes.
...so on..

And due to this attention/energy activation, not Nature but your energy/attention use the Natural/artificial resources.

Every thing(Energy)  in nature already exists in infinite form but it need your attention to capture a particular form for use of it.
Ex-
One want to suicide, their attention is always circulate towards hopeless stuff, Their attention circulate towards the objects which is completely dark ie there are no any test in that.
Their attention circulate towards the meaning less of life.
..so on. 

***Not the nature but the attention clear the path***
