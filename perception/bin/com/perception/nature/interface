Interface
===============================================
Interface(circumstance) is the mediator/middle part of flow of energy who is even not responsible to send energy back and forth.
Neither interface create nor it abstract the energy but it play important role for flow of energy(reflection).
Interface work like litmus since because of it intensity of energy increase/decrease..

             ***Mirror is just for reflection of light***
Ex-
If you feel some one love you. Here your own emotion reflect from some one and some one is just the interface for flow of love.
Since emotion build in you and you are not unable to make it direct flow, you send it to some one in the form of respect/love/serve/take care...etc
And whom you send the emotion they can't abstract, they reflect back to you only.(reflection)

***Neither can love you nor can hate you...it just circulation of your own energy***

Ex-
If you try to relate some one, some one is just interface for your own try, and you are under of own created relativity.
It may or may not some one know/ doesn't known about your relative perception. But here some one play a important role for reflection of  your reactivity.
In other words for transfer of our emotion to us only, we use others in the form of crutch.

Until one use interface as crutch unless come out from poor observation.
**Energy Neither reflect nor absorb by interface...it streaming in self only but look like reflection***

**Every one select proper mirror for reflection of energy but mirror is in own understanding only***
