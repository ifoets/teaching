Lives...A State of Nature
============================
There are undefined states of Nature/streaming and lives is of them. This is the sate of Nature look like most beautiful.
But every creation of nature is neither beautiful nor ugly except lives.
In this state nature transfer a very very small amount of power for recreation.

Trees, birds, animals, humans are just a state of Nature during its streaming.

***The existence of Nature is nothing but streaming***

Fire,Air,Water,food..so on these are the just the state of nature.
Human's lives is the state of nature where nature/streaming can realize itself.

***Neither there is any purpose of Nature/streaming nor it is purposeless, It is just in being***

***Streaming is the State of Nature***
It is just like birth,child,young,old,death are the state of life similar way
animal, bird,humans..so on are the state of Nature.
Rotation/zigzag of planet are just the sate of planes,shrinking
and expanding are just the sate of objects.
Your stress and happiness are just the state of mind.
so on....
***State of Nature are the external representation of Nature***
***Internally Nature exists in the form of streaming only***
