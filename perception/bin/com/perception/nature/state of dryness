A state of dryness
===============================================
Dryness is the sate of feeling where feeling itself realize it is in state of dye.
The intensity of feeling decrease/increase based on interaction with similar element of frequency.
After certain interval of overlap with each other the feeling reach to highest state, 
at this state one may feel delight/pain depends up on the direction of flow of emotion.

Near to state of dryness one realize the nature of acceptance/refuse, the nature of analysis,
the nature of polite/angry, the nature of observation,nature of learn/understand etc...tens to zero.

It realize realization it self not taking interest to realize something.
It neither neglect nor gives proper response to others states of energy.
It look here and there but not digging anywhere.
It realize why should and why should not are similar in nature.
It realize neither to make partition nor to make summation.
It realize neither to be come out from this state nor to be with this state..just looking with very low frequency.
It realize where is the healing and where is the drilling in feeling.

***Dryness is the state which is detectable under low state of observation***
