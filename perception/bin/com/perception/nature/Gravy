Juice of life(Streaming of Interest)
=====================================
Nature don't have any interest on any stuff/object for streaming in it.It is just the flow of energy as usual process.
Ex-
Water flow from hill to sea there is no any pleasure or displeasure, it is obvious,Neither any support by water nor it oppose to flow. it is due to gravity or the gravitational wave whose nature is to pull all object towards center of mass on which the object stay.
Similarly
When Sun rise, flower blooms,bird fly,body activity,Greenery maintain in jungle...so on...or whatever one familiar of 
any dynamic/static activity anywhere/everywhere, these all the event happen its own without any pleasure or displeasure. 
Flower not try to blooms, Sun not try to rise, Bird not try to fly, body not try to do something...No...nothing like any force but automatically as per action/reaction happen in the atom/molecule during streaming of the object/life.

**Then from where the pleasure/displease come into picture.**

When once seances collide from new wave/object/adventure ,lot of hormones generate and make them to feel pleasure/displeasure depends up on their state of energy reside in them self.
It can be observe, the lives always stay in natural place not feel always pleasure with nature relative to the lives come to natural place from some where else.

Juice of life
------------------------
Once one get the test of pleasure feel, it keep in to account as interest. Due to this test one defined every thing happen in nature is pleasure, Nature always is in delightful state, Nature is beautiful...so on.
When one get the interest of pleasure, the interest make force for repeat it/similar to it again and again.
This is the juice of life on which it not flow but the flow become ZIG-ZAG.

Nature is neither ugly nor beautiful, The activity in nature is not pleasure/displeasure...

***Nature is not bounded by any means..not at all***
***Not only Nature but also any streaming of energy not fit in any of the definition***

The adventurous event is responsible for make one feel delight and Every moment is adventurous when the one self is engage in observation.
The delight will be also decrease day by day even one self have been engage in observation since many years and finally become beyond the delight/displeasure..means..ie..

***NATURAL***
