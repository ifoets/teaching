Liquidity of heart
======================================
Heart is an organ of body where the feeling of stuff can be detect and it send the information to brain.
There are many types of feeling can be observe.Every feeling have its own frequency. The intensity of these frequency is directly proportional to the liquidity of heart.Liquidity of heart is a energetic state of heart where heart observe much emotion/feeling.

When the molecule of heart is in active state any ways the heart achieve their liquid state.At this state lives may feel high pain, high happiness, high delight or high observation, it totally depends up on the direction of flow of energy that emerge from heart.

***Felling is streaming of energy in heart.rapidly***

The way heart achieve their liquid state
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal human being
----------------------------
Every human being heart have some special sensitivity towards some particular object/events. That mean their frequency of heart match with particular event.When that event occur the frequency of event heal the frequency of heat.
So heart become more sensitive ie. it comes in liquid state.
When the energy in heart(feeling) become more it flow in many direction.
Ex-
-In the form of tear.
-In the form of fear.
-In the form of some action that break the threshold.
..so on.
If one's observation is week, one flow with that feeling, ie flow with emotion.

***Emotion is stumbling block when one flow with it***

Spiritual human being
-----------------------------
Due to yogic activity(meditation,yoga,silence, every moment observe the nature of object..so on) the human heart gating energy continuously and so it achieve some state where the frequency of heart match with many known and unknown frequency of the objects. ie. the liquid state of heart.

it is just like the pond(heart) is almost full of water(energy) and the water flow can occur even a little raining.
It can be activate in many ways like

It flow in two different following ways like..
-If one observe the love between tow lives
-If one observe the sound that comes directly from heart
-If one observe the honesty
-If one observe the struggle to find their destination.
....so on
Here even the heart is in liquid state the flow energy from heart is under some what observation of self.

Here the energy transformation can be categories in following two ways.

1. If one's observation is light, one can observe the flow of emotion only, they don't touch the streaming.
2. If one's observation have enough strength, one may turn the direction of the flow of emotion since it is under control of observer.

***Emotion can open the door of self when it's flow is under observation****
