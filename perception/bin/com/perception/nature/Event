Event
==============================================
Each and every moment of interval unlimited number of times one object transfer in to another object in terms of their design,structure,
behavior,capability,shape,bonding,color,size,request/response of frequency...etc.
But one observe the changes when we feel the changes and that become the a event for us.

/***changes is independent of our understanding/feeling***/

The unlimited no of changes happens every moment is nothing but the event. In other words changes are nothing but event.

***changes is summation of streaming for observation***
***Event is nothing but detectable changes***

We observe the event based on our sensitivity/observation power.
Whatever event we look from our seances is not the final or initial state of event but the one is the detectable state of event.
If  one realize the event/changes in the form of streaming(the continuous changes), they neither support the changes nor oppose the changes.
Since they observe how many streaming one can support or  how many of them can oppose, 
each and every molecule is in the form of streaming only in each and every instance of time.

In other words Streaming is the Nature of energy.

***Neither the streaming can be stopped nor it can be speed up after certain instance of time***
 
Human have limited power to stop or support the changes(streaming). If some one try to support/oppose the 
changes they may slightly divert the changes for just an instance of time.
 
In fact support/oppose the changes is neither meaningful nor meaning less but from the perceptive of energy one can burn their energy.

***At max one can observe the event/changes/streaming to keep int light state***
