Fear Vs Careful(Streaming)
==================================
Fear
----------------------
Fear is a abnormal/sudden feeling signal get in FOE(flux of energy streaming in brain)streaming.
The feeling of fear invent/create when FOE streaming not accept the transformation that are going to be happen in next/coming moment. One realize the transformation is so big that the brain unable to handle the stress that are going to arise.
The situation may/may not be exactly the same but the FOE perceive some critical situation. In this situation due to poor understanding brain arise the command to run away from the situation either physically/mentally/hidden ways/trying to ignore but not from bottom/ ..so on. 
In fact run away is not any solution but instantly it look like the best one.
One can take aside/fight/stay there and observe the situation/..so on..depends up the situation at the place of run away.

Careful
------------------------------------
It is an understanding which is open by default. One careful person can understand the pattern of others. One understand they go from their path and one should goes from his path, if they not give aside then one should give them aside to pass form each other.
It will not give chance to create the deadlock in any of the situation.
It is default understanding noting to think it happen automatically.

Ex- 
A truck is cumming behind/in front of some one.
Due to poor understanding one can observe this trunk is chasing me/will kill me.One can run away.
One can also understand to give aside the truck since both are on the same line.
 
***Poor understanding create the fear***
***Fear is a sleep one sate where as careful is a wake up state***
