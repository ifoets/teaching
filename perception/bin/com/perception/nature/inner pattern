Inner pattern
===============================================
Pattern is nothing but the a very smooth route/path on which we trek smoothly. This path may be made by others or it can be made by self.
We get many trouble during making the path. During building the path we make face many situation and each time we pay.

It may be known/unknown but at many state of our/your life we make many path. If you move smoothly on your path, it means you are known about the path.
If you move many times on your path, there is a state when you just move on path without even a little hindrance,it is just like walking without any purpose.

This is nothing but the pattern, ie the path become completely smooth, you never force to move on the path, you just move on this.

Ex-
A external pattern
------------------
When you start drinking, you hide it from many one since you have lot of hindrance from your closer/your self.
If you drink always, you may get many hindrance from your culture, but day by day your hindrance become less.
A time come on the path of drinking, you ignore the others statement/comment/suggestion on your drinking path.
This path slowly become smooth like you unable to think, just drink...this is nothing but the pattern of drink on wihch you move smoothly.

What will happen due to drinking, What is happening due to drinking, why I am drinking,How this happened, Till  what time I will drink, These every question
are suppressed below your path/pattern or transformed in to pattern.

***External pattern is under control of body/mind/intellect***
***Pattern is the state when you just execute without any problem/solution/purpose****

Internal pattern
------------------
Similar to external pattern there are many internal pattern.
When you start yogic kriya/meditation/silence..so on, You may find many difficulty to reach in stable state.
Many of us leave these activity on intermediate. Many of just want to look/observe during practice of these activities.
Many of us just doing these activities to keep in peace mode.
Many of us just doing as nature activities.
It depends up on person by person.

You may observe after certain period of time(years) these activity slightly inject in to our natural activity.
You may observe these activities are just like a usual work in our daily life. This is nothing but the path become smooth and you move on it without any force.
At some stage you neither think  about these activities nor try to realize what you are doing, you just do it as like you do your natural activities.
What is happening, what will be happen, how this happens so on, these type of query transformed in the sate of pattern.
This is nothing but the inner pattern.

***How much costly to build inner pattern that much smoothly to fly in it****
