***Environment(a tiny observation of FOE)***
=======================================
It is not only the place or society from where one get information. But it is the atmosphere in one's thought system in which all the interacted information float. 
In more better word it is a pond of all the information in the thought system from where one get influence or a chance to influence.

When one get in touch with some source continuously, one create the special test in their thought system that pull for more expansion for the test.After the test become solid one can take next step for further action/reaction.

Scientific/spiritual/social/natural/fiction/...so on..or whatever one read,see video, listen audio, observe the activities...that create a environment in one's thought system which may lead for further action/reaction depends up on the effect of the intensity of created environment.  

Ex-
Doctors work in a environment, that pull them to build their own hospital.
Engineers work in a environment that pull them for build their own company.
Scientist-own laboratory, guru-own ashrams,teachers-own schools, driver-own vehicles,generalist-own tv channel,...so on.
***Every one have some environment from where their thought system/feeling engage in it self***

It can be observe:-
Whatever environment in which one become young(childhood to young) that environment always pull the humans/lives.

Whatever one eaten, whatever one listened, whatever one played, whatever one done,Whatever one romanced, whatever one drink,whatever one engaged,whatever one loved, Whatever one gossip..so on....always pull towards the environment that one cross from childhood
 to young age.
Since at that age not only the body but also the hole system thought/feeling/understanding/..so on restructured and during this restructuring process whatever environment get in touch with one that make solidity in their restructured feeling.

***One select Environment where one feel fit***
