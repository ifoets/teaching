Touch of existence(Streaming)
=================================================
What ever the things in front of you that exists physically, you can touch/look/feel/understand/observe/transform..so on, that means you can analyse from your seances.

Similarly when you observe the things in front of you energetically at the place of physically, you always get only one form of energy ie the streaming of energy/streaming of physical form rapidly/fluxing of energy
Streaming of object/particle/wave is nothing but the existence of energy.
That means every things exists physically for seances, same thing exists energetically for intellect and these same things exists in the form of stream(ie continuous transformation of energy/flux of energy) for observer.

In other words static water in river is water for seances, and the same water in the form of flow is stream for observer.

When one touch the existence?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Touch of existence is nothing but the realization of streaming everywhere/anywhere only nothings else.
You can observe every object is nothing but ice of dust(particles/waves) just their shape and size is different and due to physical/chemical/energetic architecture/arrangement there behavior/nature are different.
In other words except the life energy in tree every parts of tree are just the water and soil and these water/soil is nothing but waves/particles statically.

     ***touch of existence is unexpected/sudden event***

When a yogi having doing yogic activity(meditation/yoga/silence/observation of nature/conscious on flow of emotion/..so on) since long years. The yogi's faith flow in the shape of drum. Ie the faith first shrink towards most powerful faith(ie god/aatma/parmatma/existence/Almighty/..so on) and then it collide with the existence with a blast in faith system (streaming of energy), at this place each and every faith transform in to streaming of energy only.

This is nothing but the first touch of existence. 
The power of digging become high. Now your believe system not flow blindly.
You can understand the mean of defined anything, You can understand the mean of tell/listen something.
Ie you can able to observe the flow of thought and emotion.

***One's observation change their direction after touch of existence***

After this stage you can observe the flow of you emotion/thought and activity. You mostly like to stay in keep quite mode in further life. You have very low interest to tell some thing to some one...so on.

***At this stage there are no any returning point***
***When your existence touch you...you never return back***
