Awareness
=====================================
Evey lives have little or more awarness about the stuff from where they coress.
This is nothing but the inner experice based on your capability/analysis/observation.
If you are in senseive state of feeling you can get
the awareness with hight intensity.

Every things are in under transformation forever, if you have awarness about the state come in front of you
,you will be never in worry or hurry since you have awareness.

If you haven't awarness about the stuff infront of you, you will be must in hurry or worry and the same time
you will get some awareness.

It is very slow process to increase our awareness, increasing of awarenss is nothing but 
the increasing of conceiouness/the power of observation.

It is due to the hight intensity of awareness only who realize the existence of nature  in the form of stream.
It is the  awareness only who realize the coexistence of time,space and streaming of enery.

***Awareness of most valuable stuff**

Awaress neither gives any happiness nor any pain but in the process of awarenss we get the same.
Before awarenss the infront of you is different than the after awareness.

It is awareness only who change the perception of life, How one perceice tell how they aware about the stuff.

***Awareness is osam things that get in your life***
