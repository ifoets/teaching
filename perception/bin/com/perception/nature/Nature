Nature(Streaming of Nature)
============================
This is the usual/automatically/force less/obvious... behavior of energy/flow of energy of any object/particle/wave.
Every object have its own nature depends on their internal atomic structure and the arrangement of energy or flow of energy within them.

****The center of nature is streaming of energy only***

Ex-
The nature of fire to burn something, Nature of river to flow, Nature of tree to maintain atmosphere/greenery,nature of hill to maintain peak and Valley, Nature of bird to fly, Nature of brain to think,Nature of self to observe...so on.

Every object have different nature at the extreme of streaming,
Nature never keep any copy of energy...it must be unique at level of extreme streaming.

Nature of any object cant be changed, it is immutable, if one try to change the nature of object,Both the object and their nature change together ie..nature of any object is immutable.

          ****nature of any object is immutable***
          ***Nature haven't any copy of energy***
Nature never be attractive nor be boring. It is just the flow/transformation of energy without any hindrance/disturbance.

Nature never stop it always engage in their streaming/transformation.The object automatically build is the natural one and their behavior is natural.

***Every thing is natural beyond relativity and every thing is unnatural withing relativity***

Nature is the stream of energy which flow infinitely. 
Universe is the nature of infinite composite natures.
