First Glance of existence(Streaming)
====================================================
Existence can't be explain because nothing exists except the existence itself. In other words the base of each and every thing is the existence itself.One can observe the objects are different but the base of every object is the streaming of energy only.
When one have been meditating/doing some yogic activity since long time, a time come when one realize itself and that is the first glance of existence. It may be one's observation/understanding/feeling is different and natural, but one get the solidity(turning the trek towards self) when one get the first glance of existence.
After first glance of existence the human become sensitive and emotional.

How one feel before and after the first glance of existence?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Let us assume You are the person who stay in metro city where people are engaged to much with the culture. People are highly attached with the objects and you never feel affinity within their family.
One day you go for traveling at some natural place(hilly,greenery,cold, beautiful
.. area) and you get love with some hilly girl suddenly(who is much natural/opened with respect to you), there you feel much affinity, you realize life cant be better than this and so you marry with that girl in temple where only you two are there.

***Affinity with hilly girl is like.... first glance of existence***

Assume the medium of communication is only letter.
Assume your wife is pregnant and waiting you since log time.
There every moment make your wife more emotional.
And here in metro city you are fighting with your strong respected family to consider the hilly girl as daughter-in-law.

Here your wife's emotion is just like the feeling.... after the first glance of existence.

***After first glance of existence you life glow slowly***
***Neither life is tough not it is easy***
