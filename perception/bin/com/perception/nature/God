God(Streaming of God)
================================
Is there any God(having infinite power) exists some where in universe or any where form where it control all the activity in universe or it have infinite strength/power to do any thing whatever its wishes.

No. ...No such God/power exists in this universe.
 
***Except human none of the lives need God***

Streaming of God(birth to death)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One can think, when one heard about God first time what was the imagination about the God. All most every one have similar experience like God is super power and it can do anything not only for nature but also for their devotee.Due to this understanding one get faith on God, One get expectation form God,One try to do something that can make them feel closer to God like ...pooja, prarthna, chadawa, bhajan, kirtan,create temple...so on ..or what ever one can do for God.

***Here One have created the God in own understanding***

One have faith on God at least the situation when none of the formula work for life ie. the situation in out of control/brain unable get any hopes for further,Complete hopeless situation, get fear of death,Continuous failure, Continuous frustration, Continuous fear, Continuous struggle...so on...or whatever the situation when one need help from God.

Is the God Works(leave its existence at this point)?
Yes....it works some times but not always.

***Faith on God create a hope for life is the center of its existence in human understanding***

How God works without its existence?
-----------------------------------------------
When there is a trouble and one memorize/pray God.
.....what action/reaction happen here....

When one is in trouble, their brain(the thinking power) is in very hindrance state.There is complex confusion like deadlock situation, just like complete block for certain period of time.
At this time heart feel/call the help form God, due to faith on God one left every thing on God as one know God(infinite strength) will do every thing better then me for me.

Since one leave every thing on god their brain not engage for solving the dead lock. At this time brain get relax since it left the fighting to come out from dead lock and due to relaxation of brain it get capability to think next(ie. dead lock is over). And this happen since one have deeply faith on God. The density of faith/feeling matter here.

It can be understand even in 100 critical problem if only 1 get resolved(get direction) due to hope/faith on God without doing any task. Can any one try to understand the concept behind the God...No..No need, Every want the thing should work, is exists or not doesn't matter.

***At this stage God not only exists but also the most powerful tool for any given time and situation***

When the density of faith become very dense..specially for the inner trekker the faith blast and it transformed to streaming of energy everywhere in universe
At this stage there are no any God(infinite strength) but the streaming of energy is everywhere and nothing is beyond the streaming.

***The stuff make you relax is magic for you***
