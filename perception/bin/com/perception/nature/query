query
======================================
Query is the bubble arise on surface of mind, it arise when one observe unknown about something or even a very thin hindrance in known stuff.
When one digging into self it not take the form of word/sentence but when one try to take others experience then they arise query
and get the other's experience in the form of information.
If one satisfy instantly then they realize it is right answer of the query otherwise they try to dig the same again.
When mind arise query the same time simultaneously mind create space to fill the query by correct answer.

Query is the cigarette  that X throws to Y and Y burn it and smoke become the answer from that cigarette (query).

***Neither there is question nor there is any answer***

we query life time but never get complete satisfaction from answer since both the question and answer are in dark.
Same query have different answer for different person in different instance of time by single person.

Observes give same answer to single query in different way using different word but they say same thing always, it depends
on listener what they receive.

If you arise query from inner self you will get answer from your own created inner intelligence system not from the inner self.
In fact there is no query flow inside, only the nature of observation float inside in the form of streaming.

***query is the seed and transformation of same seed in the form of tree is nothing but answer***

***Neither seed(query) nor tree(answer) exists since both are just two phase of digging***
