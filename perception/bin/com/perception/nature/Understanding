Understanding(Local/Natural)
=========================================
What is understanding? Why one need understanding.
------------------------------
Let first come to Observation since this is the eyes/door of understanding.

Observation is the nature of self, this is not the brain functionality but the functionality of visible/invisible energy that have control over the attention. The density of attention directly proportion to the density of observation.
Ex-
Before one realize cold, the skin of body get in touch with cold and after the attention send signal to observer the wave finally reach to brain(flux of energy).
Ex-
Driver brain is not responsible to drive the car but the attention one.
Active Senses opens the door of observation,The observation may considerable or not that is different thing but if the senses are active the observation is in action.The observation that goes to be consider is a understanding.

Understanding

Local Understanding
Understanding take play the role for drive the life. This is the understanding who make differentiation one form others.This is me and that are you. This is mine and that are yours  
The any relativity that comes under local understanding.
All the words/action/reaction/activity having some feeling injected into these stuff comes under the local understanding.

 ***Understanding drives life***

Natural/Global Understanding
---------------------------------------
Any understanding not belongs to some one neither me nor you or nor any others. Is is the understanding of energy(FOE) who sustain/maintain/drive the day to day activity of their body.

This understanding capable to observe the streaming only.
Each and every particle of this universe highly engage in their streaming, this understanding just observe their streaming without any feeling.
