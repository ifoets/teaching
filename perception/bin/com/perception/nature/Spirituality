Spirituality (A Journey within)
================================
A journey within is very unique and highly personal trek for every one. This is the base of life from where it flow with nature.
The very light KRIYA(meditation/yoga/silence/observation/emotional vibration/inner healing...so on) has been used by one to trek towards self.It is the unique trek for every one.It need not necessary every trekker have common experience, it may or may not be. It can be understand like.. if many people trek on Himalaya  together but their experience are different. The difference in experiences are due to their power of observation and the dimension of observation.
Whatever one gather the information for inner trek before start the trekking may or may not match during journey.
Every moment of trekking one should follow the inner self before proceed the next step.One can get many and many adventurous feeling since next step is always unknown before movement. During trekking the newly invented emotions and balance with them is very important for the journey.
Many times during trekking one may get the feeling of lost/death/unable to feel one self/delightful/very emotional/inner healing/illusion/reality/love/natural.....so on...or many known/unknown feeling having good density.

This trekking is not for one but for the nature reside inside one(self) who maintain the order of once life. One can understand this is his journey science one is also together with self not separated during trekking.

There will be a pick view known as witness when one realize whatever one observe anywhere is reside inside brain streaming(FOE) and the observation of stuff dissolve with feeling of self. One can realize, I m not the body but the magnetic field in which body sink. One can realize every thing in nature are in very high streaming state. One can realize every thing exists in a unit of time but extreme streaming none of thing exists....so on....

***Inner teak is infinite(where realization lost itself)***
