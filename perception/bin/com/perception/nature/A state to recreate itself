A state to recreate itself(‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡§æ/‡§¨‡§π‡§≤‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§∂‡•ç‡§•‡§æ)
========================================
Each and every state of energy have their own purpose if it look in the frame of life but when one look the same in the frame of streaming of energy then the same energy/waves
have only one purpose ie streaming or in the state it exists forever. In other words energy/waves have neither any  purpose nor it is purposeless in the frame of streaming.

When we come in the frame of life it get break in two parts(internal frame and external frame) and both the frame have it own purpose, in fact both frame energy/waves always
moves towards stability/ satisfaction/ happiness/ affinity/ peace/feel good/smoothness/lightness.
Both the external and external frame active with its capability but many times/mostly external and external frame work in opposite direction but their purpose is same(stability)

External frame work for existence of our own created existence whereas internal frame work towards the existence of streaming of energy. The approach of both are similar for stability but their direction are in opposite. One moves towards world and other moves towards within.

What is a state of recreate?
---------------------------------------
But during movement many time energy (mind/ senses/intellect/observation/understanding/realization) get stuck at some phase due to poor arrangement/structuring of waves..only at each and every step of activities. It is nature itself none goes beyond it. Maximum anyone come on the state of streaming/   with streaming or current state of streaming.
But during movement many time energy (mind/ senses/ intellect/observation/understanding/realization) get stuck at some phase due to poor arrangement/structuring of waves.

If at the state of get stuck, one have sufficient energy then recreate itself and come out from that state or with the help of some one the recreate state get created and it is helpful
to come out the state of stuck.

***Recreate is a magic of quick stability***
***Recreate is the state of preparation for further stability or to safe the destroy of patience***
***Recreate is the state of just restructuring of waves/energy or patience/be with it/acceptance of current state/long breathing during state of stuck***

Whatever is the state on winch we rotating/moving get stabilize using recreating the state in new form.

Ex-
-If you are tired from you life and you are not ready to run away form current state then you make take a long breath and recreate by using observation,
-you can recreate with looking some hopes
-you can recreate by using fundamental/basic thought like what will happen will see that time but now what can we do will do sure.
-You can recreate by using previous experiences

***Recreate is the state for just change the attention form the state where one get stuck for restoring/restructuring the energy***

Note:- Recreate always quick stabilize the state, If you are in state of mind/senses/feeling or observation /realization /understanding.
You are in external frame  or in internal frame. 
You are in journey of wold or you are in journey within.

Ex-
External:-
When you lost most valuable things and then you recreate by using patience like recognizing your capability/work out to pull the same/similar thing in your life.
You may look nature/nature phenomenon is the best way to recreate the state.

Internal:
When you lost the rhythm/healing in meditation/yoga/silence then by using observation look the current state like it is a experiment to realize without these activities what human
feel/observe/think/realize.

***One should use the state of recreating for further stability***
***The poor state of recreate is to slide from path***
