Play with Self's Emotions
-------------------------------
Emotion is the most detectable live/stream energy that flow within us with every action of mind.
Due to flow of emotion only we realize  pain , happiness or  delight or what ever the feeling this is due to flow of emotion only.

1. If flow of emotion is in different direction where we don't support it from inside we getting pain since we want to stop it and due to that we fight with it,
2.if flow of the emotion in the direction where we support it we feel happiness.

Fighting with emotion or supporting to flow of emotion both are same thing just difference come later and we realize it also later.

When we support the flow of emotion we flow with it and we want to flow continuously but the intensity of the same emotion decrease after certain instance of time and we again fight with it's for flow.

Intensity of reaction in every instance of energy is not constant, it increase/decrease depends up on the input of energy supply for reaction.
If one is enough to observe not only the flow of energy in the form of emotion but also the intensively of flow then one can play with that emotion.
Playing with emotion means neither to flow with it nor to fight with it but just observer to it and int's intensity of flow.

One can realize tremendous healing during observation.
In the state of play with emotion one can turn slightly left or right the emotion but no need to turn ..just be with it's flow lightly.

***Emotion is stumbling block as well as it help to drill the ego***
***Without emotion neither one drill ego nor one tense***
