Greedy state of searching energy/satisfaction
=====================================
Every one is in search of satisfaction ie. means the same one is in state of unsatisfied.
If we are in unsatisfied state, it is obvious we try to find here and there something that can satisfy us.
A very little state of sanctification we can get by hit and trail in world that is never useful for smooth life.

***The ways(hit/trail) by which we get little state of satisfaction is noting but the greedy state of searching energy***

If we don't find any way who provide continuous ways to satisfy us then obviously we select the greedy ways to satisfy us.The greedy ways of satisfaction is just like the dog get test of blood from the bone.

If you observe just before you want to speak, You can observe speaking is the intermediate/interface the thing scene behind is something else ie.. need of satisfaction only.

If you want to ask/query something, just before ask you many observe why? you can get this is the greedy way to know the answer of query, the answer is here the
intermediate things the seen in behind to satisfy greedily..

If you want to abuse/demotivate/jealous/compete/relate..so one, if you observe, you can get these are just the intermediate/interface but the scene behind
is nothing but the greedy state of searching sanctification.

If you try to show/impress/influence..so on, just before to do the same,if you observe why? you can get these are nothing but the intermediate stuff but scene behind
to do is nothing but the hit/trail approach to find the satisfaction.

***Our desire is nothing but the greedy state of searching satisfaction/energy***

These are nothing but any ways/hit/trial ways to find the satisfaction.
Ie these are nothing the way of begging the energy.
Every human use hit and trial approach to satisfy them self, you can observe the approach is for instant only.

***Satisfaction is one of the most costly stuff, you cant catch up by hit and trail****
