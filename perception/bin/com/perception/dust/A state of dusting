A state of dusting
=========================================
You can look the dust when you move on path, dust is the collection of tiny particles fly randomly by air. The collection of tiny particles without any stable waves structure.
It always move here and there with movement air/object 
around it. It expand easily, it settle down easily when it not get any disturbance,it fly easily due to little flow of 
air.
You can also see the collection of dust int the form of waves(circular) in storm it get the power of destroy something/make fly the light weight object.

Similar ways our senses/ mind/feeling /observation /understanding/realization so. on, are in the form of dust when it has lack of energy(storm of of inner energy). When our senses/mind /feeling are in form of dust then it can't makes valuable changes in our life since it haven't caliber to make the effect. Since our life is directly attach with these
activities our life also become the dust of life. The dust of life always face the bad luck, the dust of mind/emotion also facing bad luck.

***Dust of life is nothing the distributed state of life***

It is the power of energy to act on something, if the same energy are in the form of dust then the action also proceed by that energy is in the form of dust of action only.

The architecture(mechanism behind) of dusting
---------------------------------------------
You see the dust on road, how it get build?
Simply when the vehicles move on road the soil on the road get break in small particle and these collection of particle is nothing but the dust. There are many stone on
the road also but it not simply get transformed in to dust since its internal structure/bounding is strong enough. But the soil have poor bounding between their particles and
it simply get break due to movement of vehicles.

Similar ways when your thought/emotion is get constructed by senses/mind/lust/poor understanding/lack of energy..so on, it get simply break in the tiny parts and hence it
become the dust of thought/emotions.
When you thought/emotion get constructed by external source or lust it never be in strong state since it depends up on the stream of external source, due to poor energy injected
into that thought/emotion get get easily break by another external sources and hence it become the dust.

You have to do many task, you know very well you will one at a time but you think all task together is nothing but the dust of thinking. Due to poor understanding we makes our
thought/emotion in the form of dust and hence our life become the dust of life.

***Dusting is the center of poor understanding and poor understanding is the center of dusting***

Without supplying sufficient energy the collection of dust never become stone, you have supply sufficient heat on collection of dust then it become break/stone.
Similar way you have to supply sufficient energy to within to form you thought/emotion int the form of breaks/stone.
You have many closer/relative/family/security and none of them works for you when you are under state of transformation since for transforming of the life these all are looks like the dust of energy/objects.

***Every one is hungry for energy and every one fight with energy only***
***Dusting of life never get imagination of smoothness of life***
***It is the dust energy within who distinguish the objects,who looks the objects at the place of energy***
