A state of angry
========================
Normally almost human become angry in their life some time, some one show by using words/action/expression some one suppress the same. Whatever the emotion you get initially
if you have interest in that emotion then the same emotion need more and more energy to build it. The first emotion is seeds and if your attention is on that emotion then the
attention supply energy to that emotion.

Emotion is nothing but a state of energy within your heart, every energy is useful if you know the same otherwise the same energy burn you together. How do you feel when some
one take care your/support you in critical situation/love you, of course you feel good and what is your next state from them who supply energy, you expect more energy at least
the same when you again come in critical situation. If they ready to pay then it is fine, if they not ready to pay latter your expectation break.

Ex-
-The base of your building(X) on other's land(Y) and you makes many floor on their land but when they try to dig their land(Y) what will happen to your building, of course it
will collapse.
If you good understanding then you never make your building on other'ares land.

-Have you observe the people making building on the government land and finally happen to this building, every materiel present their only when government making collapse their 
building but after collapse these materiel become dust, the material form a beautiful house when they are in arranged form and the same become dust when they get disarranged.
 
***Expectation is also a form of energy till it get, but when it break the same energy get disarranged form since its stability depends up supply of energy form external source***
***Attention is nothing but the point of energy, just like torch where you focus that place things come in light***

When your expectation get broken then your expectation energy become dust and because of your poor understanding you never arrange the same energy and finally you become tense and this tension transform in to angry.

***disarranged form of energy is very powerful to move towards its stability***

When some one pressurize/suppress you, if you don't reply at the same time then you used their supply energy to diminish your balanced state of energy, when this same process run
many time a time come in front you that you are not capable to suppress your energy/emotion and but even you trying to suppress the same energy, due to suppressing the energy
the space of energy become small and molecules within that limited space aggressive to break the space for their stabilization and finally a threshold come in the form of angry.

***If energy within you are not very unstable then angry not suddenly come, it give you much time to arrange energy within that emotion***
***Angry state of energy come at very last state before that it cross many structure/non structure..ie the process of stabilization***
***None can misbehave with energy since it is existence and it always try to stabilize their state what you feel during that process is nothing but your understanding***

Angry state of energy is active form of energy but these energy is just like dust of energy ie their internal architecture/arrangement to make/transform in the form of single waves.

Ex-
When you pump air in tire then you suppressing air/molecule of air in small amount of space and since all the molecule try to come out form tire and hitting contingently
to inner area of tire and hence due to hitting of molecule a pressure get created and hence your tire stay in tight state, ie suppressed/pressurizes state of air,
but if you supply more and more air then automatically a time come when air molecule break the threshold to stabilize their state and break the tire.

***Angry is the completely unstable state of energy ie disarranged form of active energy, active energy means aggressive to stabilize its state***
