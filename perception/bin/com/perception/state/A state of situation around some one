A state of situation in front/around of us
==========================================
Normally every human being many times realize they are surrounded by many problem/situation in their day to day life. Many times they try to resolve it and they get success or failure many times. Some time during resolving the problem and they feel this is very complex at intermediate sate and from that time their attention change the direction towards run away.

Same thing  we do in our day to day life but normally we didn't observe the entire phase of problems/situation during solving it. If one observe during solving the problem they can
understand how energy in us flowing towards solution?/when it try to change the direction?/when it try to speed up/when it try to slow down?/when it try to leave the problems/
when it keep patience?..so on.

If you look the above states during resolving the problem then you may come on some solid understanding like it our understanding only who fired the command due that
the above scenario get emerge during resolving the problems and then you can understand they way of fire the command towards solution.

One more valuable thing you may observe when you take many of your problems together in a group that yo u have been crossed in your past.
You can observe normally each and every problems from that you crossed seems to be complex at first sight but when start to do then same problems seems to be resolvable at intermediate state and when you had resolved the same it seems to be it was not much complex as it seems to be in first sight.

***Breaking the stuff in tiny part and collecting the stuff in a group construct a different waves for observation***

Have you observed how many problems come in front your life and how many % of problems you had resolved?
If you will collect many problems from last one year to now, you can observe all most all problems get solved by you only, or you was in center/responsible to resolve the same. By this observation you can also observe whatever problems come in life that are solvable by you. Ie is it  just test of your approach /energy but anyhow you success to resolve almost all problems.

A very rare problem come in front of us that we unable to solve ie beyond of our capability.

***Every situation/problems in front of us are near about our caliber only***

Ex-let us,
Some riot emerge in you district, do you get responsibility to resolve the same even the same one is happening in front of you?
No, The commanding responsibility of waves/energy get transferred to district magistrate since they have control over district.
If the same riot is not controlled by DM, it get transferred to higher level of authority again and again till it not get resolved.

You may observe how the waves of energy get transferred step by step to higher level of authority based on complexity of problems..
There are many problems arise in family/society/state/country/world/..so on, even there is a little/more chance you get affected by these problems but have you get responsibility to resolve these problems?

No, you always get responsibility near to your caliber only,you take the same responsibility or not it is up to you.
If you will take responsibility then only it will resolve is not like that, if you wont take responsibility the the control of waves/energy get transferred to some one else
but the same problems must get resolved.

***You are just a source of energy to transform some energy and it is a Chance for you, if you wont come in front then some other source of energy automatically come
in front for lead***
