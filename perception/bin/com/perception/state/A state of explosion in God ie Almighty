A state of explosion in God/Almighty
=======================================
All most all human being have some assumption about God. These assumption depends on what information they get about God in their life.
1-Some one assumed it is a central power and that power is responsible to all things in this universe. 
2-Some on assumed every movement happening in this universe is in under control of God.
3-Some one assumed God is the creator ie every creation do by God. Some one assumed due to fear. Some one assume due to greed/lust.
4-Some one assumed if we follow God their focus on us is more. 
-Some assumed since they try to know them. Some assumed God gives pain/happiness.
5-Some one assumed if they worship God they will change their pain into happiness or at lest they keep us away from pain.
6-Some one assumed God is only one and many are only their messenger.
7-Some on assumed based on their religion.
8-Some one assumed God is in temple
9-Some one assumed life is a drop of God
10-Some one assumed life energy is nothing but the part of Good.
-..so on
ie God exists in our assumption in the form of how we gather information about God, it also change time to time as you gather more and more information or if you put your mind some what on collected information analysis.

Is really above statements about God is Right/Wrong?
-------------------------------------------
***Neither above statement about God is right nor these statement is Wrong too***
This is based on your understanding ans assumption what it make to seems to be.

Why not Right? and Why not wrong?
================================
Why not Right? ie the above list of statement.
==============
On surface of mind
------------------
Since these are your assumption, you have't even a little understanding about these. So these exists on your surface of mind.
ie If god work for you as your assumption then you realize this is right but when the same god not work for you as your assumption then you realizing more in next zone
and get hindered but you will never break your assumption since you need to check the same again.

On/In surface of intellect
----------------------
This is not completely on surface of your mind but root of these assumption is in mind and the tree of that root in your intellect so here the assumption become some what
strong ie you have some confident about your assumption about God. So God work/not work for you but you it affect on your assumption some what less.

On/In surface of your feeling
-----------------------
When your assumption get strong state, it create feeling of the same assumption since your assumption is strong your have more confident and you may seems to feel God.
Before your assumption get transform in to feeling you personally gone throw much analysis and every point you find God exits as you assumed.
Since the base of your analysis is your assumption only so during analysis your mostly your assumption is deviated towards god. ie you are not Neutral(तठस्थ) during analysis.
Here your strong confidence about your assumption only get transform into feeling and due to feeling your your feeling many interact with your assumption of God.
At this state your assumption get solidity about God but here also the base of feeling is assumption only.
At this state you have solidity in your feeling but during justification you may take aside with statement I feel it and I can,t make you feel the same.

In your observation
-------------------------
When your mind move/transform into next state ie, observation throughout passing from feeling.
Observation  have its own slandered and quality so your observation analyse your feeling little Natural with little deviation towards your assumption.
At this state you get little understanding about your assumption about god but things is not very clear as it should.

In your realization
--------------------------
When your observation are in state of transformation towards realization then your looking capability increase and try to look as it is.
So your energy of assumption get centralized and finally become like a point and this point get smaller day by day.
At this state your root of assumption getting Uprooted (उखड़ना) slowly since realization cut/melt the root of you assumption->observation->realization.

Before explosion happen in the smallest point of energy(transformed form of assumption->observation->realization), your feeling towards god is increase so much
and you may feel lot of fear and you pray to god when this fear make you in mode of vibration.
At this state you many realize only god can same me not any else that why at the state of vibration you pray to god from your bottom of heart.
***At this state God become your trump card, you can use it anywhere/everywhere when critical you find****

Why not wrong too? ie the above statements
===============

In your understanding
----------------------
When the point of energy that start transformation form surface of mind to realization and get smallest.
This this state normally human not aware what is going on but point is in under radar of inner self.
Now  the smallest point is in under flow like stream of energy and finally get explosion in that highly concentrated energy of your assumption.
After explosion in that point it get expand to each and every particle/waves/molecules/atoms..or whatever to smallest particle and then your understanding getting transform in to stream of energy.
This is nothing but explosion in God/Almighty.

So above statement is not wrong too since..energy is one in overall, every stream/object are just instance of energy only.
Every things are under control of energy..so on.

Just we use stream of energy in the form/named of god(emotion state of energy)...there is a valuable secrete/mechanism hidden behind this also...you may find it :)  

At this state your assumption get transformed into stream of energy.

***Energy tends to zero during streaming in your understanding/realization***
***You can understand the existence of stream of energy,stream of time,stream of space***
***You can understand how coexists work together in the  form of steam****

Now your understanding/realization move to next state towards the existence of life energy and their form.
At this state you have a little visualization of the history of creation/revolution of life.

***Now you state engage in life energy/streaming of life energy***
***Your continuous supply of energy/mediation/yoga/silence is only responsible for tremendous transformation***

From this understanding you can understand the expansion/shrinking of atoms/particles/object/universe.
At this point you can realize the creation of black-hole.

Your god work at every phase of above explanation and it directly proportional to how much your assumed energy get dense.
Ie it is not the god but the energy inside you that support your assumption->feeling->observation->realization only play the role of god and when you surrender to them your mind become free and you assumed your god is working.

***At this state you understand everything exists in the form of stream having infinite speed of transformation/streaming**** 
***After this understanding your conciseness get engaged in life energy and mechanism/arrangement/fashion/wave of its creation***
