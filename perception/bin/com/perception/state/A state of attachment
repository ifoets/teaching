A state of attachment
===============================
If you observe whenever you meet some one for any purpose first time, you never/very rarely get realize any stress during first instance of meet, it may be during 
meeting you realize some thing else that is different things. 
Since two person ready to meet first time then they both know their purpose very clear. They know each other little/more but the knowledge of each others get distributed to them
via some medium not by face to face meeting.
Since they don,t have clarity about their virtue and so they don't asking more from each others.

First of all why we get close to each others, it is simple our understanding matching with each other/our sense realize some thing is in others that one might require at particular period of time ie gating/expecting some what energy from each other in any form, Otherwise after fist meet only our senses decide we should go for next or not.

***Not our senses but our poor understanding is very cleaver and greedy in nature***

But what happen when we get close to each others?
------------------------------------------------
There infinite types of waves gating in touch with each others, In other words infinite types of waves exchange between them at every instance of time.The purpose behind exchange of waves/energy only the stability only nothing else.
And due to exchange of thought/emotion/(the detectable form of exchanging waves)/energy, our senses/mind realize what energy it can get from others.
It seems how to get in next state,it also finding the way/some path in next state, if it gating concrete path for energy from others in next state,
Now in next state mind find the time when it ask for energy and in further state mind prepare for arsing..so on

The above mechanism running internally in our different states of mind when two person start to gating close.

***When mind start seem to be, it gating transformed in next state of seeming**

Birth of attachment
-----------------------------
Ex-
Assume two person are the atoms A and B and both atoms need some electron to complete their octet(the stable state of atom).
When A and B get close to each others they seems to be fill their octet by sharing their electrons to each others.
They trying to share every moment of time but every time they didn't share electrons completely but they are sharing the proxy of electron
ie the cloud of external part(low intensity emery) of electron.
Proxy of electron never give the high intensity like electron to each others and hence they never get their octet in their entire life.

***The proxy of energy always create the seeming during its exchange that lead for further exchange of energy.***

Every time due to poor understanding we seems to be complete our octet from others energy but we never get filled.
Due to our poor understanding we never realize none can give us high intensity energy, every one can exchange the proxy of high intensity of energy only
that always look like high intensity of energy in our first site due to our lack of understanding.

***The Proxy of high intensity of energy is nothing but the initial state of attachment that always in state of seems to be and finally transformed into attachment after certain period of time***

Why one expect from others to fill their octet? since it seems to be easy without pay much more/without high level of work out/without high risk/without waste of more time.
Since every one realize to reach to their stable state and searching energy in very greedy mode.

None can understand they have sufficient electrons to complete their octet but these electrons are in inactive mode and none can share their electrons to others to fill their octet.

***Master fill their octet by activating their inactive electrons but even they cant share their high intensity of electrons to another to fill their octet****
