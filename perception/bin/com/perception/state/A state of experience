A state of experience(‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§∂‡•ç‡§•‡§æ)
=========================================
Every one have senses,the power of observation and realization based on energy level in them.
The only difference are in their intensity for sense/ observe/ realize.Due to this difference only every one of us perceive in different direction in our life.
Due to this difference only many of us move smoothly in life and many of us always moving zig zag, Many of us relaxed in every time and situation and many of get 
tens easily.

State X:-
If state of energy in us at stretch state(engage to find a drop of energy here and there..ie mind is running in state of friction) then our senses get privilege 
to drive the life. 
Our senses are not capable to look the internal sate of stemming in object but it is capable to look on the surface of objects.
Our senses are only capable to detect the activity of object ie. it concentrate only on object/the movement of object/the expression of object/changing the state of 
object/behavior of object..so on.

State Y-
If state of energy in us at a relax state(gating continuous energy from some source..ie mind is in relaxed state...just like as mind is in sleeping state) then our 
observation get privilege to drive the life. And the capability of observation(depends up the intensity) is much better than senses so it look into the object. it not 
engage on surface of object but it start digging into the internal mechanism, it trying to observe the reason behind the movement/changing/behavior...so on of the object.
 
 State Z:-
 If state of energy in us at healing/streaming/flowing state(having sufficient energy and mind is in flying/floating state) then our realization take privilege to drive 
 the life.The capability of realization is much higher than observational state since it bind with feeling. In this state realization try to realize the flow of energy in the object It realize the center/secrete of streaming in object is hidden in the flow of energy in their molecules, It tending to zero.
 
At every state X, Y and Z we experience something at each and every moment of life.
 
At state X if we experience something we need/require certain force to convert into activity since force need energy to keep the activity in live state but due to we 
already having very less energy at this state, the activity get loose after certain period of time and hence whatever we experience get lost or may stay in life with 
very low intensity.
 
At state Y if we experience something we require/need a very little force to convert into activity since force need very low energy and you have not lack of energy at this 
state.
So the activity get inject in life for certain period  of time till we supply energy to sustain the same activity.In this state after certain period of time the intensity of
 acquired activity get decrease after some what log time or it may be injected for life time if it get transformed into higher state.
 
At state Z if we experience something it directly get injected into life and no need to keep the experience in your memory and it is already in state of flow in life.
At this state you may realize many things already flowing in your life but you get experience get latter when your face some scenario. At this state you no need to take
 care the experience. In fact your experience take care your journey automatically.
This is nothing but a state of experience.
 
 ***Experience is just for clarity of life/energy/streaming of energy/flying***
***Neither any Experience is right nor it is wrong, it just an experience.e what ever you feel/realize in your journey ***
