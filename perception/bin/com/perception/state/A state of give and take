A state of give and take
=================================
Our life as human being daily cross from give and take state. This give and take make a circle for tranmission/movement of object from one place to another place.

We put energy for study we get some information is a give and take state.
We distribute some thing is a give and take.
We buy something is a give and take.
We do job/business ia a give and take.
We clean our cloth is a give and take.
We distribute love/affection is a give and take.

***Whatever wo do action is a give and take***

There are threee type of state for give and take.

1. Give and take instantly ie on the spot/pay use together
At this state we exchange the object/energy/stuff instantly. One things can be observe/notice at this state both the transmiter and receiver are agreee before exchagne completly
then only they exchange the objects.
In fact in this state both the source and destination become deliver and receiver together.

Ex-
When you(X) buy a pen from shopkeepar(Y) for that you pay rs 10.
First X is agree to pay 10 to to Y
Second X transmiter rs 10 and Y receive rs 10
Third Y transmit the pen and X receive the pen.

ie X and Y both become transmiter and receiver together.

ie what every the bond they make during excution is instantly/dynamic and the same bond get disconnted on complete tion and furthere they don't keep in mind
who have taken that pen or how much we accept amount..so on. Since before exchange they understand the process of exchange very clearly.
At this state neither side have any issu.

2. Give first and then take later/pay first then use

3. Give later and take first/Use and pay
