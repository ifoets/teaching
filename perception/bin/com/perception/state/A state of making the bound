A state of making the bound(‡§¨‡§Ç‡§ß‡§® ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§•‡§æ)
=================================
Each and every object get constructed due to bounding in their elements internally. 
Atoms get constructed due to bounding in electron,proton and neutron.
Molecules get constructed due to bounding between their atoms. Element get constructed due to bounding between their molecules.
Object get constructed due to bounding between their elements. Machines get constructed due to bounding between their objects.
Family get constructed due to bounding between their family member.
Circle/Society get constructed due to bounding between families.
District get constructed due to bounding of cities/villages.
States->bounding in districts,
country->bounding in states,
continent->bounding in countries,
world->bounding in continent,
solar system->bounding in planets,
 galaxy->bounding in different types of group of planet systems,
black hole->bounding in different types galaxies, 
Universe->bounding in black holes,
Big universe->bounding in parallels of universe.
......so on towards infinite.

Many planets move in universe freely and gating towards a state of bounding ie after certain period of time they will be in state of bounding.

***Humans are connected due to bounding in their emotions/ thoughts***

ie Means each and every things are connected by some bounds only. This is bound who taking part in streaming of energy/ objects.

Process of Bounding and non-bonding
-------------------------------------
When two atoms/elements/molecules..realize affinity with each other, they realize stability to making bound between them then they get bounded.
Ex-
H(Hydrogen) and O(Oxygen) both realize affinity between them due to unstable state of electrons/energy in them and get connected by bound and transformed into water(H2O).
This is nothing but the creation of bounding between H and O.

When Cl(chlorine) get near to H2O, H(Hydrogen) getting more affinity with Cl than O(Oxygen),If sufficient environment exists that place then H break lightly the bound with O
and gating bound slightly  with Cl and making HCl. Since Cl(having 7 electron need one 1 more electron to get stability) have more intensity of energy than Oxygen(having 6 electron)
This is nothing but non-bounding of H and O and bounding of H and Cl.

Why bounding and non-bounding?
----------------------------------------------
This is due to they get stability to makes bound/ non-bound in their realization/affinity in both of the scenario bounding and non-bounding.

Ex- H(Hydrogen) get stability in bounding with O and gating more stability when non-bounding with O and bounding with Cl.

***Bound is nothing but one of the lightest state of energy***
 
When we feel week/fear/insecure/unreliable/unstable, we automatically search to overcome these feeling and trying to make bound with others.

Till now you can understand each and every things bounded each others using some bound in either ways and the reason behind bounding is nothing but to reach in higher stable
state.

***Bounding is completely natural, it is a state of nature itself, this is center of existence, this is center of streaming of existence***

But what happen when we/humans get in bound with other human being and realizing due to this bounding only we getting stress? Is is really the valid reason?
-----------------------------------
No, Not at all
Bounding never gives you stress but due to your poor/foolishness understanding/realization make you to perceive towards the direction of stress.
Ex-
If you observe the above chemical reaction between H and O and gain between H and CL. You may realize some thing else.

They makes the bound and break the bound in light state ie.. easily, just they perceive towards their affinity and higher affinity.
H don't care what will happen to O after breaking the bound with them, it just getting more affinity with Cl and simply get towards Cl.
Since this is the nature of energy, None can stop the affinity of element/object since it happen in each and every state of molecules/atoms.

Here how many electrons (1)  need H for its stability from O, O is completely agree to share their electron with H and how many electron(2) O need for its stability from H, H completely agree to share and due to mutual co-agreement both get bounded and they never care what transformation happen due that (H2O).

Have you been observed after bounding they don't need anythings further form each others. 

Human also makes bounds between them but due to poor understanding they makes the same bound in tight/hell state.

Molecules don't need any things from each other after bounding, having between them, since before start bounding they execute every process and after bounding they don,t need anything else rather than to just stay connected by bound and hence bound between them always  is in light mode, when they realize to break they break without caring each others.

But in case of human being if the bounding perceive due to poor understanding, Human makes bound with/without co-agreement but after bounding they start needing with each others
ie increasing the intensity of expectation and due to that the bounding between them become tight.

***Molecule/nature/energy did/processed every thing before stat the bounding where as humans do/process every things after the bounding happen***
***Due to tight bounding only human realize stress to break and or to stay in bounding***
***If one don't expect any thing at all from society and they are bounded in society, it never realize any stress at all due to bound***

***Bounding is not humans problem/stress, humans problem/stress is due poor understanding/ realization/ affinity/ observation only****
***Every elements are free to bound and unbound due to light bounding***
***Humans never realize free for bound(in suspicion state) and unbound(in fear state) due to tight bounding/previous experience***
If you are able to realize, you can realize when just you get in bound with any at the time you feel stability but after some time what happen to you so you feel stress in bounding.

This is due to you increase the intensity of expectation/affinity
for more and more stability and hence your bound become tight, Naturally after bounding whatever you realize to gating/loosing
is nothing but the your poor understanding only.
 
If you make bound with your inner self, it will never be in tight state, it is always in light state since inner self always execute a process that kill you expectation timely.
In fact you can't make bound with inner self but when you have sufficient energy the bound get created automatically between you and your inner self.
Your maximum task is to supply sufficient energy to your self either ways.

***Bounding is heart/breathing of nature/streaming of energy/is in being***
