A state of the feeling of death(FOD) during journey of life
===============================================
In normal human being scenario very rare chance to get FOD during their journey of life, But there is a possibility in the normal human being life also.
But in case of Spiritual human who have been practicing
 meditation/ yoga/ silence from long time in very regular basis, and after certain period of they mostly getting this type of feeling many times in their journey.
When this types feeling getting start in our life then it is not easy to come out/overcome form this state, due to FOD meditator get stuck some times in their journey. But since spiritual human practice meditation regularly and they have sufficient energy to balance their feeling so it not affect much, 
but their radar is rotating on this feeling, they try to know what is this, when they come out from this feeling then only they know what was that.in fact this types of feeling comes due to meditation only in the life of meditator.

In special case when one meditate without any GURU/guide line, they have much more chance to get this feeling during their journey.If one meditate under some GURU then their guru aware them time to time about changes happen in them so they get but due to awareness they realize it with low intensity.

Have you been observe you get young from child/you get old from young,old person get physical death but you never get FOD during changing this state(child->young->old->death).
Even you feeling getting changed during these state of transformation also but you never get FOD at least in these state of transformation.

Do you have been observe any old person getting FOD even they are near to physical death? very rare.

Why?
------------------
This is due to your awareness, when you get young from child, you have seen many human get young from child in front you so you have awareness about this transformation
and when your state change form child->young->old even your perception get changed/your feeling get changed but you understand this is obvious happen with every one since you look every day this types of transformation in front of you. Here you have awareness with you who stop to realize FOD.
Similar way the old person have awareness about physical death, they look many person after old get death and so their awareness make ready for this transformation.

But why spiritual person get the FOD many times in their journey?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Due to regular practicing of meditation/yoga/silence their energy get accumulated in his body/mind/intellect on. Even they feel about this but they one aware the internal rapid transformation in them due to continuous supply of energy, and so after certain period of time when their chakra/points of abstract energy get activated that time their mind get the sudden information having very high feeling. Since sudden change in feeling if mind is not aware about this types of feeling, it unable to accept it and they get high fear this fear only lead to get feeling of death.
Since you have not observe this type of transformation in our life to any one, you only aware about physical transformation (even the center/base of physical transformation is also
lead by internal transformation), and due to non awareness of your energy/feeling/perception transformation your mind never accept at first site it since mind is always rigid with the
stuff that it know.

***Mind is intelligent to accept the information but it is very poor to accept change in its believe***

Why mind not accept the energy/feeling/perception at it first site? even it get high stress during that.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 The physical transformation is some what different then energy/feeling/perception transformation. Since spiritual transformation happen with very high intensity of energy, mind get challenge for its existence and mind is very rigid for its existence and due to rigidness of existence of mind even mind get high stress but it try to refuse the changes(but changes already happen and waiting for acceptance of mind).
 
 When spiritual person get FOD at least they have awareness they getting this because of mediation so FOD not make much pain to him. 
But when this FOD come in life of normal human being they don't have any base like(meditation/continuous supply of high intensity energy) they suffer a lot and this suffering take very long time to overcome, even they start meditation/yoga after FOD.
 [
 (Personally one took lead to handle one of my friend(normal human) who got FOD after he hand off form top quality hospital/doctors in Bangalore..now his condition is not all most fine but now he rarely come to meet /call  :) ), 
Here task was just realize him there is no way to come out from here just to listens some one's experience, you have to supply energy(yoga->meditation) to you and your energy only make you aware form FOD at any cost, Some awareness (information) get supply form here and some small but concrete awareness from his own practice.
]
 
 **Fear of death is nothing but due to non awareness of transformation arise in our energy system***
 ***All most all person get release from FOD at the time they get awareness***
 ***In this state either we need some experienced guys who got out from FOD or have very high patience without leaving practicing the meditation/yoga/silence***

*** Fear of death(FOD) realize you the end of time(EOT)***
Overall:-
*** How much painful the FOD that much it is blissful too**
