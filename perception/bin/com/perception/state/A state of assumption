A state of assumption
========================================
Every human being have some what experience about assumption of stuff. If we don't have enough interest to know then we normally assume it for temporary purpose.
This temporary assumption many times take lead for further action/life and many times it start digging/ finding/ knowing/searching too. It is not you but the poor state of energy within you who is painted by many layer of smoke/cloud not allow itself to move towards knowing since the same energy realize it haven't caliber to interact 
with internal energy of object/stuff/situation.

***Every energy/object/activities interact each other when they are in same/similar state***
***Assumption is the first site to interact with upper layer/smokey layer of stuff***

When we assume something then it get stored in our body/mind/intellect/observation..so on. It is responsibility of state of energy within us who use this assumption.
If state of energy within you is poor then it work with your assumption as it is assumed. But when your state of energy within you get at higher state then the same energy try to look inside their assumption, it try to dig/search/find/observe..the mechanism behind the stuff.

***Observation directly scan the assumption from many angle/approach****
***Assumption is the base of knowing the stuff but it is just in dark state***

The state of assumption may get started by sate of fear/ greed/lust/jealous/a drop of satisfaction/illusion..ie by using poor understanding but if someone transform this state
of assumption into next state then they can get clarity on each state of transformations.
Only collection of seeds/assumption is not enough to fly/heal in life you need to supply sufficient energy to your self and that energy only transformed the seeds/assumption into tree/energy/streaming of energy.

***Assumption is a seeds of knowing, you need supply energy to this seeds then it become tree***
***You not only know the stuff but the stuff also know you together, ie interaction arise with similar state of energy***
***You not only assume the stuff but the stuff also assume you together***

Why we assume?
----------------------------
It start at poor state of energy within us, when we require something, we try to look from where/whom can get the same one. ie. it start due to lack of energy in us. Assumption is the first site of interaction with stuff.

Ex-
You need money urgently then first site to find who will give you money quickly, if you find the name of person who can quickly provide you money and your state of assumption gating started. ie you don't know he is right person to give money, he have/haven't sufficient money, will he give me, will ask interest during return..so on. These all scenario within our assumption are in dark state and when you reach to him these all scenario come in light state one by one.

Ex-
You assume god/almighty at highest state of pain/ stress/ complex situations since you need quick removal of pain,
Your assumption of god normally work when you are in very pain/stress and depends how much density in your assumption/density of surrender.
But when you finding god/Almighty and you go near and near to it, you realize at each and every state of transformation of yourself who was god in your assumption and who is god in your observation/who is god in understanding/who is god in streaming of energy/who is god in tends to zero..so on.

***Assumption is first site but it need supply of energy to move in next state***
***If we keep our assumption as it is then it will stay as it is***
