A state of gating test
========================================
Each and every human being having many types of test in their current state of running life. they engage the life with these test. It depends up the intensity of test mind recall these time to time by its call back mechanism. If mind realize near to test it get activated to test it again.

First of all it should be clear there are are many phase of test human capable to test.
It is totally depends up on energy in you or the state of consciousness in which we are streaming.

1. A test by senses, this is nothing but instance guide of human or it differentiate the things instantly.

Ex-
-Our eye system differentiate winch path is better looking, it differentiate the colors/shape/size..so on.
-Our tongs system differentiate the test of sugar/ salt/ sweet/ water/ milk..so
-Our touch system differentiate the temperature/smooth/hard..so on
-Our nose system differentiate the smell of flower/food/ so on
-Our ears differentiate the frequency of sound noise/ songs/ statement..so on
These caliber is natural it get automatically when the things come in touch in our senses instantly.
It is obvious, every one gating the test by their senses.

***Senses work like gate,This is the entry point of energy inside us.
***Test by Senses is the gate/entry point in our physical/ mental/ intellectual/spiritual..so on.. world.***

2. Test by mind...ie energy move to next zone/central state of senses(collections of senses transformed into mind)
Ex-
At this phase/gate of test mind check what is good for it and what is bad for it, what it need later and what it don't require later.That is mind take admissions of energy/object for next time entry without checking.Mind gives the pass/Id card for further entry/next time entry since mind need energy for their transformation into next state(observation), it the nature of every energy to moves towards stability and gating transformed when it get sufficient energy.
Till mind gating test in energy it keep remember for welcome that energy.This is the entry point of energy form where we feel this energy/object is testy/needful/useful/meaningful/required..so on
If mind realize there is no any test of a particular energy/object in coming time, that energy become non valuable and automatically disconnect with mind(ie just like pass out the student from college).
Here mind gating in use for maximizing the stability of human being but since the stability of mind with energy is always in high unstable state, mind never complete the highest state of stabilization. This is simply due to low energy/poor understanding.
If mind get sufficient energy then it get transformed into observation.

This is the state where mind get into attachment mode by using the test of energy/need/greedy of more energy since it require more and more energy but 
their capability to absorb the energy is minimum every moment of life.

***Normal human mind engage with energy/object in this zone/state only***

3.  Test by observation..ie energy move to next zone/mind is in state of transformation towards observational state
When you have sufficient energy or consciousness, it not simply take test in object/energy for needful/useful/testful...so on rather than it get energy for same manner(for use in stability) but it approach is slightly different that the state of mind state.
In this state observation(since it is capable to dig) dig the internal state of energy and it interact the quality/higher intensity of energy and due to that observation get more energy during analysis of object/energy.
Due to gating more energy only in this state we feel relaxed during observation, we can't fight during observation.
Test exists here also but there approach is different than mind.

***Fight stat when one need more energy but gating less and they don't change the direction gating stuck there only due to poor understanding***

4. Test by realization...ie observation transferred in to realization..next zone

In this state realization dig the object/energy in the form of stream and here the purpose is also same(stabilization) as purpose of mind/observation but approach is different.
And due to its approach only it directly interact with stream of energy, realization gating much energy and gating much more stability.
This energy is sufficient for activate our abstract energy hidden in us and hence we feel light/in healing state.
At this state test also exists but the bound between realization and energy is in lightest mode.

***At this state we gating sufficient energy for our stability***
***Mind only transformed into observation, observation only transformed into realization, realization only transformed into understanding...so on till it reach to in its stream state***
