A state of incomplete cycle of wave
===================================
In our day to day life many times we realize the lack of object/energy or something else. When we look some object/ energy and if we realize it should be with us, it should
be mine. Many times it is out of our capability and some times it is in our capability. Some time we try to make it close and some time just we keep in memory for further process.

When the object/energy is out of  our capability completely then the waves of wishes get almost truncated but when we realize there may be a chance later then we keep in our attention.
When the object/energy is within our capability then we try to make it close and when we makes close the same we realize after some times it seems to be normal object/energy
as many of object/energy close to us.

Our wishes/desire is a waves only, when we feel lack of something the same time it try to get created, the magic here is when the waves of wishes get created it is always is in
incomplete cycle of waves. Every things try to maintain it stability since it is nature. When our incomplete of waves(desire/wishes) get created it also propagate towards completion
of its cycle.

Our wishes/desire not simply get created, something is/are in our reachable/about to reachable/seems to be reachable then only it try to get created.

Ex-
-Normal human being never wish/desire to become PM why? It seems to never reachable
-Old human being never wish/desire to  become child/become pilot of fighter plane
-Child can have wishes to become young
-Arts student have never wishes to become a scientists of physics
Why?
Since it seems to be never complete the cycle of wishes, so it never get created.
But when it seems to be reachable it get created and after it perceive in the direction to complete the incomplete cycle of waves.

***Our wishes/desire is nothing but the incomplete cycle of waves get created when it seems to be make complete cycle***

How we feel when our wishes/desire get created some craziness to find the wishes, the craziness is nothing but the towards completion of waves cycles.
What happen when the wishes get achieved, when it get completed it realize some little satisfaction, when we realize satisfaction that is the exact state of perfect
completion of cycle of waves.
After completion of waves cycle it is over for further stability but our poor understanding finding same feeling as it get during completion of waves cycles.
Due to our poor understanding only we get stuck on the same state of completion of waves cycles since it gave maximum satisfaction, we don't understand the mechanism behind
our satisfaction.

***Every waves follow the drum shapes, its intensity is maximum when it is get complete structure and minimum when it try to restructure***
***drum have expanded shape on both corner and at middle it is thin shape at middle***
***Natural waves always naturally get completed since before start get created only it fulfill all the fundamental for its completion/propagation***
