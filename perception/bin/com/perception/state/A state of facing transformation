A state of facing transformation/streaming
==========================================
Every object/energy always/forever is in under transformation due to streaming nature of nature. Streaming is the existence of nature ie existence of each and every things 
in this universe are in state of streaming/transformation. How do you take this streaming it is up on you, you may adjust with changes, you may enjoy with it, you may suffer form it, in fact it depends up on
the state of energy within you.
If you have lack of energy then you automatically suffer from the changes,if you have sufficient energy within you then it may look smooth and if you have flood of energy
within you then you can enjoy/play the changes.

In other words it is the experience/awareness that make you feel smoothness during transformation.

Ex- You get many physical changes in your life but due to that changes you never feel stress since you have awareness about your changes from the atmosphere.
-You get very little changes in your mental state or feeling comparison to spiritual changes and due to non awareness you feel stress many times and you feel happiness many times but when the changes in mental or feeling/observation gating change in spiritual human it is not easy to face the transformation.

Facing Spiritual transformation
--------------------------------------------------------
Spiritual transformation is not easy to face specially at the initial state of transformation. You may get very high pain due to non awareness or due to non acceptance of
transformation.

In spiritual transformation the intensity of energy get changes contingently and hence your mental state and feeling gating changes many times form lower state to higher state.
Every one try to accept the transformation into them by using some imagination/patience and looking here and there but since you mental state also gating changed and that is center of acceptance so it is very difficult to accept.

Many times spiritual people loose their confidence due to higher state of pain but if when they supply energy within continuously then there will be a time comes in our life
when each and every transformation gating accepted suddenly/easily.

This is the initial state of when human feel them self in the form of energy. They observe the object in the form of energy. They realize everything already/forever in the sate
of transformation.
This is nothing but the energy within who accept/face smoothly the each and every transformation. When the energy within come in state of observation then the observational
state of energy are capable to look at the place of flow or fight with the transformation.

***It is the observational state of energy within who face easily the transformation since it is interested in looking only***
