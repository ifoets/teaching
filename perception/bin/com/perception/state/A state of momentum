A state of momentum
====================
Each and every human having littel or more experiences about momentum since they all get the same one during their action. 
Some one have experice of momentum during thir study for building their future.
Some one have experice of momentum during playing/entertainment/flying kite/teaching their children/arranging energy for building somethings/moring walk/yoga/meditation/
silence/lisening romantic songs/writing thier experriences/serving some one/wriiting by writer/..so on.

Ie normally every one get this experiecen it is different thing their base may be senses/mind/observation/realization/understanding/streaming, but every one have the same
experience.

What is momentum and how it come in life?
=========================================
Ex-
How one get momentum for riding their bike?
Before get momentum they have to learn well,they need to fill pertorl, they need to caliber to buy bike,they need to build confidence to run the bike anywhere..so on.
So momentum is not comes in picuture easily, it need much energy supply, in other words the moementum come easily that lost easiy also.IA state of momentum
====================
Each and every human having little or more experiences about momentum since they all get the same one during their action. 
Some one have experience of momentum during their study for building their future.
Some one have experience of momentum during playing/entertainment/flying kite/teaching their children/arranging energy for building somethings/morning walk/yoga/meditation/silence/listening romantic songs/writing their experiences/serving some one/writing feeling or observation by writer/playing game..so on.

ie doing something deeply(having much enough interest to do) form long time

Ie normally every one get this experience and it is different thing their base may be senses/ mind/ observation/ realization/ understanding/vibration/streaming, but every one have the same experience little or more.

What is momentum and how it come in life?
---------------------------------------------------------
Ex-
How one get momentum when one riding their bike?
Before get momentum they have to learn well,they need to fill petrol, they have caliber to buy bike,they need to build confidence to run the bike anywhere..so on.
So momentum doesn't comes in picture easily, it need much  energy supply, in other words the momentum that come easily get lost easily also.

***Supplying of energy is proportion to the intensity and long life of momentum***

What is momentum?
--------------------------
Is is the starting state of rhythms of any activities. When your understanding are capable to understand/realize the flow of energy in rhythm then it search from where this rhythm come in picture and your understanding find the initial state of rhythm is nothing but momentum.
It is just like your bike gating speed of 60 currently but there was a time when you change a gear and supply acceleration.
The moment when we supply the acceleration is nothing but the momentum.

Similar way when energy get activated within then there was a time come in front of us our inner momentum try to accelerate many times and after absorption of
sufficient energy it get the moment and the same momentum transfer into rhythm later.. 

How momentum come in life?
-------------------------------------
There is only one central principle supply energy to within/self, how does one supply is not big matter but the intensity of energy always take in account.
Momentum of life not come easily since it require much more work out in consistent ways.

Our central task is to find the consistent ways/source from where we can supply not only the maximum energy but also it should have high intensity.
From this point every things take care by accumulated energy, It is the energy only who get in momentum and the same one get in rhythm.

***Momentum is nothing but the starting state of healing/rhythms***

What is momentum?
-----------------
Is is the starting state of rhythms of any activities. When your understanding are capable to understand/ralize the flow of energy in rhythm then it search from where
this rhtym come in picuture and your understanding find the initial state of rhytm is nothing but momentum.
It is just like your bike gatting speed of 60 currentyly but there was a time when you change a gear and supply acceleration.
The moment when we supply the acceleration is nothing but the momentum.

Similar way when energy get activated within then there was a time come in front of us our inner momentum try to accelerate many times and after absorption of
suffient energy it get the moment and the same momentum transfer into rhytm. 

How momentum come in life?
-------------------------
There is only one centeral ways to supply energy to within/slef, how does one supply is not big matter but what is the intensity of energy always take in account.
Momentum of life not come easily since it require much more work out in consistent ways.

Our centeral task is to find the ways/source from where we can supply not only the maximum energy but also it should have high intensity.
From this point every things take care by acculated energy, It is the energy only who get in momentum and the same one get in rhythm.

***Momentum is nothng but the starting phase of healing/rhythms***
