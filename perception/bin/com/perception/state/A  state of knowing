A state of knowing
=============================
This is state of observation from where observer not satisfy from their understanding.They realize this is just a smoke.
They move in next level of observation. They resize nothing is known for me.
They understand the internal construction/bounding of molecules inside object.
They understand the behaviors of object. They understand the relative nature  of object.
But the same time they realize the object/energy/wave is completely unknown for me.

In this state there is negligible test to understand the things because there observation 
continuously digging the object/energy to know.
They realize whatever we understand on the basis of science/chemistry/physics/psychology/behavior/nature/society/news/touch/feel..so on, 
these are the first phase/state of understanding.
 
They realize these understanding is not enough to stop for further digging.
They realize the base of understanding is knowing only,other any knowledge is just for discussion/for teach some one/for open the shop/
for impress to some one/for writing the books/for further digging/for lecture..so on.

Ex-
They look to water not for diking but for knowing
even they feel thirstily.
It is obvious if they feel thirsty, they will drink but before drink their attention go to know what is this.

They look fire, they look life, they look tree, they look stone, they look situation, they look planet, they look them self..so on
means wherever they look their attention first attack on digging to know.

They neither support to do anything not oppose to do anything since their interest is not in do/do not do
but what they do their attention inject to know, whatever they did previously they do the same thing but at this state
their attention is centralize to know the thing during process of doing.
Their thirst to know anything increase day par day.

On the extreme state of observation they realize each and every things /object/energy/wave/particle..or whatever the things look like exists in the some form all they are under very high rapid reaction/transformation.
They realize everything is in state of streaming. They realize infinite no of transformation arise in any object/energy in nano second of time.

They realize streaming is not the innermost state of everything but streaming is the state of everything till where we reach by our observation. They realize this is the state of nature only.

***They observe,their observation tens to zero together with digging the object in the form of stream****

***Every thing exists in the  form of stream only always***
