A state of obstruct the dark wave
=====================================
Every human have relationship with some one with the name friends,lovers,parents,child,guru,god,teacher,mentor,boss..etc.
There are lot of wave transfer from both side for each other in the from of body language,communication,interaction,touch,activity..ie by some action.
These waves heal the filling of each others Due to this healing you get the feel of respect,take care,love,closer,security..etc with each other.
And due to these feeling we maintain the relationship.

If the waves transfer from one diminish the intensity of feeling to other then other feel diminish in healing and feel stress to maintain the readership.

The wave transfer in light mode always heal to others and the same wave transfer in dark mode they diminish the healing.

There is a sate when observer realize there are many waves transfer in our relationship and many of them are dark wave
and due to that dark wave only both suffer in their relationship.

The observer obstruct the dark wave between relationship and a high intensity observer convert the dark wave into light wave.
Neither any relationship is good nor bad it is your understanding with self that make it good or bad.
It is your poor understanding that realize your relationship is tightly coupled or loosely coupled
.
***Dark wave create and transfer due to poor understanding only***
***Dark wave is nothing but the expectation that suppress others as well as self***
***Light wave is nothing but the love that heals to others as well as self***
