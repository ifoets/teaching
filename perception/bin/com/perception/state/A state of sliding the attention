A state of the sliding attention
======================================
Attention is very important part our journey. It is our attention only due to which we realize/ observe/ forget/ heal/ remember/ fight/enjoy/sad/look in future/look in past/stay at streaming/reading/writing/lusting..so on something. Not only the attention but also the intensity of attention taking part
in digging the stuff.

Where we put the attention these we realize something, From where we pull the attention there the stuff get disappear.
It is just like every place is completely dark and attention is just like a torchlight, where you focus there you look something. It is depends up on ours sight for what we
focus on and to where we focus on.

It not only just focus on stuff but also it highlight our purpose. If our purpose is poor/strong the intensity of highlighting will be poor/strong together.
And our purpose is nothing but the lack of something in our self. Until we feel lack in some purpose unless we digging in the direction of our purpose.

Lack of something in us is nothing but due lack/insufficient of energy in us. Insufficient energy in us since either we don't create it at regular basis or we burn it due to poor understanding.

 Out attention also need the density of consciousness, In other words we can say attention is a torchlight and light emerging form it is nothing but the consciousness.
 Ie Our purpose, attention and consciousness together present in some action.
 
 Why does our attention not get centralized on a particular place?
 --------------------------------------------
 Each and every one is engaged in search of happiness/smoothness in life/peace..so on ie nothing but the energy/particular state of energy . 
 Different humans have different understanding about energy, some one look money is the source of energy, some on look happiness in family is the source of energy, some one look power/fame/royalty/govern..so on is the source of energy. Some look meditation/yoga/silence/balancing/acceptance..so on is the source of energy. Based on different understanding different people perceive their attention for receiving the energy in different direction but with every realization
 they don't find the concrete source of energy for them. So they change the direction of attention every moment here and there from were they get even a drop of energy.

 Changing the direction of attention every time for receiving the energy is nothing but A state of the sliding attention.
 
 ***Entire life our attention slide here and there since we unable to understand none of others can create sufficient energy for us***
 ***We unable to understand energy is the base.It is not only for life but also for surviving the life in smooth ways***
 
 Why our attention get centralized on a particular stuff?
 ---------------------------------------------
 It is simple when one realize the center of energy is within we don't slide our attention here and there rather than we move our attention towards the center of work out with self.Day by day we get more and more energy from self and due to increase of energy with us our self,our attention get density and finally it centralized with self self/work out.
 
 When our attention get centralize perfectly, our journey move in the next zone ie smoothness of life come in picture.
 
 ***Every one should have to find the sea of the source of energy for them self****
