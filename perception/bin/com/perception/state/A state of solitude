A state of solitude(एकांत की अवस्था)
====================================
If we meditate from long time or have been doing yogic kriya from long time, We realize our feeling change year by year.
The changing in our feeling is nothing but due to accumulation of energy in our self.

There are many action invent from meditation in our life due to accumulation of energy. Every invention in our action is nothing but due to changing the state of feeling/realization.
After many changes in our feeling a state come in front of us that slightly attract towards the state of solitude.

This is the state when we always look towards solitude of life. We realize this is one of the best state in current moment.
This is the state when we not get any problem with others but we always give privilege to this state.

Why one need solitude?
--------------------
In fact this is neither the need nor the requirement but our feeling is in such a state we automatically slide towards solitude.
In this state observation become some what more light than previous one. Due to light in observation, our observation start observing to self/self's activity.
In this state we are under inner healing when we are in solitude. We feel much delight in solitude.

Ex-
This is just like, you have many enjoyment in front of you, what you will select, obviously you will select one that give the most happiness.
In this state one realize the pattern of enjoyment. If one find the pattern that keep them delight every moment without any external support, obviously they slide towards that pattern.
In this state you get a very little confusion about your existence.Some time you may realize it is not me who slide towards solitude, it is the energy that find the simillar frequency
in solitude and automatically slide.

***Inner patterns are for delight only since one already paid for that***
***If some work out make your life delight day by day, you automatically slide towards that work out***
