A Nest/Cave of Life
===================================
Nest is the most secure place where birds hide themselves during storm or heavy rain.

Humans have many types of nest in which they keep their secure mind before situation arise.
If you try to know something you have not only sit with that but also observe dispassionately.

From whom we feel any types of helps they are nothing but the nest for us.
Our closer are the most visible nest for us.

If we keep in nest the same time we miss to fly in storm .ie. to know the storm.

***Nest is the just a membrane***

One have to come out from secure zone to know the insecurity. How much one close to insecure
 that much one close to know the fundamental of insecurity and security both.
To come out from secure zone is not means the physical movement but the mental movement and
same time be in secure zone is also the mental state of security.

***The things is in being, they will be always is in being only, none of interface disturb it***

In fact nest not secure us but it make us insecure in the from of hindered.

***None of the cave/next secure anything since Neither streaming is in secure zone nor it is in insecure zone***
