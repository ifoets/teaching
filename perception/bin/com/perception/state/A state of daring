A state of daring
====================
Every human have some experience about daring when they approach their action even they realize it is very difficult but it can be.
When their attention on result before using the state of daring then the base of daring is poor and it always track the result since it get created by the state of result.
But when their attention on state of approach/path/movement then they get the experience and value of daring, since in this scenario they focus on their approach
 state by state.
Here they gating the momentum and finally the same momentum get transformed into rhythm since the base of this daring is their current energy.

Daring is one of the precious action taken by human being when they are in critical situation, if one think/understand, will look/will see next step then this state come on picture.
If the base of daring is poor, it never gives the better experiences since their base always makes hindrance in their entire journey time to time.

***Daring means just will see/will look next having high stream of patience***

If one is dynamic and if their understanding rotate towards the state of movement ie. not on the complete process then they have understanding about energy flow little.
Then they look daring as usual/obvious step towards life
They realize energy never be in static state, it always in state of streaming. They step up using daring or not it not stop the streaming of energy but daring is just a chance of us to support/stay with streaming.

***The base of daring is your abstract energy***
***Daring means unable to pull/push by some state but it is with the state of movement/streaming***

There are two state of daring.
--------------------------------------
Daring towards external life:-
---------------------------
This state of daring change the state different than their inheritance, It can change the state of your life, It can change the living style, It can change the approach of action.
it can make you more powerful, It can make you more confidence, It can make your more polite/honest/kind/deep analyse/dynamic.so on

How one get daring in external life?
-----------------------------------
There are many sources like inspiring books/ audios/ quotes/ humans/activities of some one/nature/natural lives activities/flow of natural resources/transformation of natural
resources/story of inventor/story of success humans/stories/poems/songs/saint/yogi.. so on

These are just for sparking for abstract energy withing you instantly and your active state of abstract energy who makes you for pick up a state of daring. Normally before daring you feel complexity in your life and trying to find threshold that prepare you for daring and the above inspirations stuffs just spark/activate your energy and that energy break the threshold and you pick up the daring state.

***After daring every one feel light, if one not feeling light then that is somethings else not the state of daring one***
***The honesty with your self is the abstract energy with you on the path/state of daring***

Daring towards within
-------------------------
When we start journey within and for initialization of inner journey normally human practice meditation/yoga/silence..so on. During start of these activities we really unaware what we doing, We just practice regularly.
Due to practice of these activities our abstract energy gating more and more energy and it start to move in next state(activating).
When our lower abstract energy get sufficient energy to transfer into active state then it get activated with some explosion in abstract energy.
At this state our feeling completely get uncontrolled and unable to think what happen to us, we realize that never imagine in our entire life.
At first site it realize we got mad, something happen in our brain, some time we may feel like madness, some time we may feel where i came/reach ,I don't know.

Our every awareness get washed, some time we may feel our life get in very very trouble state, Some time we want to return back in previous state.
We unable to think what should we do next. We may get very high fear this is due to unawareness/adventurous in feeling.
At this state many of us leave these activities since we loose our patience.

This is the first state when yogi need daring, It is not simple daring to overcome this state. From this state we move next only by using daring like will see what happen and ready for anything/everything.

***Inner daring is nothing but ready for transformation***
***Inner daring move towards explosion of our current state of existence***

During inner journey we need high daring at every point of explosion of abstract energy. But at the first state of explosion many of us take long time to take daring.
At the first state of explosion of abstract energy we completely get unbalanced for long time and in this state we have to take daring. It is too much tough but a little awareness makes us ready for daring.

***With first state of inner daring we put our life in hand of within energy***
***Explosion in abstract energy require high daring, it is like ready for anything/everything***
***Daring toward within is challenge of our current existence directly***

***External life daring bright your future where as internal daring light your life***
