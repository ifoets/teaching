A state of the flow of energy within human being
================================================
Transformation / transmission of each and every object are under control of streaming/flow of energy within/ surface/ surrounding of object. Without flow of energy nothing is perceive in this universe.

Human being is also an object which contain the energy in some special arrangement and due to that arrangement of energy within human being they are able to think/feel and act independently.
In fact human body not act independently but it seems to be act independently. Human body works with senses injected into that using external source of energy or the chemical changes arise within body.

****Energy within human being either flow from surface to bottom chakra or from bottom chakra to top chakra***

Case 1: Energy flow from surface to bottom chakra.

Whatever energy gather on our surface is nothing but the energy who makes you realize your existence. ie the energy on your surface able to distinguish the object in the form of object not unique in the form of energy.

Why surface energy realize the objects are different?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Since energy on surface has very less caliber and due to less caliber it not inject/penetrate into object and get stuck on surface of object and  hence it realize the object are different. It perceive with the activity of object not with the activity of energy flow within object.

Why human feel lack of light energy/why human feel lack of satisfaction?

Every human being feel lack in their life, since whatever energy your mind (the controller of surface energy) gather from external source they use to build more concrete rigid/confident mind and if it exceed to build mind(light energy) then it transmit towards heart and from their the energy get transmit towards bottom chakra.

Almost all human being energy engage in Case 1: activity and hence they feel lack of satisfaction in their life. It is obvious nothing is strange here.

Case 2: Energy flow from bottom chakra to top chakra
None of external source of energy that gather from mind are capable to make blast to bottom chakra. Since your senses are not capable to observe any light energy form  external source.

If you have been practicing deep meditation since long time. There will be a time come when your bottom chakra get sufficient energy and hence get activated. When your bottom chakra get activated at this time you don't understand what happen to you, why do you feel very strange, You are not capable to discuss with any one. Until you not come  under
awareness of your state of energy you may suffer lot.
This is touch time for every SADHAK since they realize life is different they realize/feel himself differently. They feel/observe something that they never realize/feel before.

This is state from where energy within your body get flow from bottom chakra to top chakra .

Why it is difficult to observe the flow of energy within body gating up or down?
---------------------------------------------------------
After activation of bottom chakra only you feel the energy gating transmit up from bottom before that you always feel energy gating towards bottom. 
*****The flow  of energy towards bottom chakra is noting but feeling lust in life/lack in life/non satisfaction in life*****

Whenever you feel lightening/healing in your life you can observe energy within you transmit to up and whenever you feel lust in life you may realize energy within you transmit towards bottom.

***Your intention to practicing meditation should never be activate the chakra, let it be happen automatically.***
***Intentionally difficult to meditate even***
***If energy within you are sufficient then automatically you feel to meditate***
