A state observing/detecting the transformation
=============================================
Not only life but also each and every things are under two process/state known as transmission and transformation. Neither of the object/energy/waves are in static state.
It is the state of nature/existence who keep each and every object/energy/waves/particles in state of transmission and transformation.

Changes arise in two ways in each and every particle in this universe, one in the state of location and other in the state of internal structure changes. Streaming of object/energy
in the form of transmission/motion and in the form of transformation always are in process. By using the principle of transmission and transformation nature keep every things
in state of live.

***Every atoms/molecules/elements/object/energy/waves/planet/galaxy..so on are in state of transmission and transformation together***
Ex-
You move from one place to another place in day to day life that is nothing but state of transmitting of you body from one location to another location, you can't stay one place
statically, in fact nature keep every things in state of velocity/motion/transmission by location. You body movement/ body part movement is nothing but the state of transmission
of body/body part. you can't keep you body/part of body in state of static long time.
The process of movement of your body/part of body are always in state of velocity/transmission.

Your body/mind/senses/observation/realization/understanding changes day to day life sine it is under transformation. You can't keep mind/observation in state of static. It is
not the nature. It is the energy within life always in state of streaming/changing and your body/mind/observation/ understanding/realization is nothing but the state of energy
within you and that energy are in state of transformation then it is obvious your mind/observation/understanding/realization get changed. This is different things you get some
solid experience and that not gating changed from log year but it will also get changed after some time since that is is the state of nature.

***None of things away from the state of nature**
***Transmission is one of the dimension of nature and transformation is another dimension of nature and both together keep the nature in state of live***

***Every things is new at each and every moment of time since they follow the state of nature***

You gating changes in your behavior/emotion/feeling/ understanding..so on at each and every moment of life but you unable to detect the same. This is because you haven't sufficient energy within. Many of your activities are passing through you without any detection due to lack of attention/ energy within you.

But when your mind get transform in to observation who have somewhat better attention power than mind then your observation automatically detect many of the transformation crossing/passing within you.
As like when you move from one place to another place your mind is enough energy to detect the change in location at each and every step of you movement. When you body part
move you mind can detect it easily since this is the physical movement. But you mind unable to detect the flow of energy during movement of body or body part.

***The transmission happen in body/part of body is the physical representation but the actual work done in the form of energy internally***

When you observation are in state of rhythm then it automatically detect the transformation of mind/observation/ understanding/realization. It is the energy within you only
who detect the state of energy and they correlate the different state of energy within and finally to reach to detection of transformation of energy within.

***Observation keep every valuable transformation in live as like nature keep every things in live***
***It is the sate of nature who keep every thing in state of live forever***
***Every one can detect their transformation of body and mind when they cross a state child to state of young and to state of old***
