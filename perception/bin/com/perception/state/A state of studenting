A state of studenting/learning
=============================
Not only the state of senses/mind but also the state of observation/realization/understanding are always perceive towards studenting. The state of studenting are always in state of running in human life. It is obvious of the door of learning is open whatever the state you are running only differentiate the the matter of learning. But what you studenting is depends up on the state of energy within you. In fact your vision always interact with symmetrical state of energy.

***Studenting is the state of thinning/awareness towards the object/energy or their behavior/flow***

Ex-
-When wood cutters move in jungle their state of learning how to cut the wood better way, which wood is easy to cut, which wood gives more fuel, which wood become dry quickly.
When travelers move in jungle they try to look the creation, they try to learn the nature and its creation
When saints move in jungle they look towards the balancing of jungle with nature, they look the flow of energy form jungle to life and from life to jungle
so so..
Ie every one is in the process of learning/studenting, but what they learn it depends up the state of energy/understanding/observation within them. Learning is a process by which you can thinning your activity and thinning of activity is nothing but movement from object to energy only.

***Studnting/learning is the process by which you move from lower state to energy to higher state of energy ie thinning of object activities or activity of energy***

It is learning process by which you get the power of analysis, the process of learning help to improve your state of life. It help you to understand the object/sate of object
/the behavior of object/the energy within object/the state of energy within object/structure of object/state of the structure of object/creation of waves/state of creation
of waves/conversion of non structure of waves to stable structure of waves/streaming of energy/the state of streaming of energy/transition of object/the state of transition of
object/transformation of object/state of transformation of object/transmission of waves or energy/the state of transmission of waves or energy/the transformation of energy/
the state of transformation of energy/energy within/the state of energy within/increase the power of observation/finding the state of observation/realization/state of realization
/understanding towards self's/state of understanding towards self/the bonding/the state of bounding
// so on.

Everyone should open the door consciously during any activities, the learning activity normally keep the ego aside, it is one of the beautiful activity by lives during their journey.

***Studenting is the process by which a state of object realize its existence***

Everyone are in state of learning during every activities but every one learn different things for the same state of streaming of object/energy since they have different meaning
of learning, their state of energy within them support only symmetrical state of learning.

Not only learning but also what one learning is important for their further movement of life, it is the process of learning drive you life and it decide the direction of life.
There are different state of humans on this earth even they born as similar state but due to their different learning process their state become different.

***Studenting nature of lives is always live but which phase of studenting is open is depends the state of energy within and their need***
***Observation state of energy is master for learning the state of energy since they have to looking capability and they only look***
