A furnished state of path in the journey of life
===================================
Every one of us cross different state of mind at each and instance of time. Based on that state only we perceive our action.Based on that state only we realize/ observe/ understand/or realize nothing to be understand/ fight/ careless/lazy/responsible/crazy..so on.

State of mind is nothing but the our current state from where we move in next state/zone for thinking before act on action. If our current state realize our future is insecure then obviously our action is to secure the future. If our current state realize we get the problem in future it is obvious our  action perceive in the direction to look how can overcome the same one.
If we realize, we should have own object then it obvious our action perceive how to take the  object..so on.

Ie. we select many path in our journey, if we feel capable to move on the path many times we move on selected path. ie At many stage of our life many path come in front of us and every path end with a little satisfaction. After ending the path the same one look like test less.

Ie On Before/after ending the current path there are many other's path architecture rotate in our mind.
Before move on every path we realize/expect some satisfaction and even we get some what too.

Due to lack of realization/understanding the above similar process run in our entire life. And every time we feel our hand is open only for further path.This is nothing but the non furnished state of path where every moment of life we plan some time we success some time we will be failure.
But changing the track is never be over in our entire life of journey.

***If our observation are under state of relativity,  we never get any furnished state of path***

If we observe in our society/circumstance many people realize for what they born and because of this realization they take a step towards their realization.
They may or may not success in their life but due to that realization only they put high energy on that path and they realize their life is in satisfaction state.

Ex-
Some one  play some game entire life having first priority.
Some one singing in their entire life with priority.
Some one serve the human being in their entire life.
Some on interact with nature entire life
..so on

A yogi also realize some thing in their life that change their path for entire life after that realization.
When one select/pick up a path for their entire life without any time and situation, They never come in state of relativity on his path.
They realize a long race of horse on their path, They never take a break on their path just moving like word is flying in sky.
This is nothing but the furnished  state of path.

***The signal/direction of furnished state of path always come from the bottom of heart***

All most all human being move smoothly on their furnished state of path without any time and situation after certain period of time.
Since they are under healing to move on that path. They never look what are the path of others.
They use their abstract energy to move on the path and since the abstract energy provide them high intensity they realize this path is the best for them.

***Neither any path is right nor any path is in wrong direction, but when it become the furnished state of path, one get stability/balance state for their entire life of journey***

***The  priority to move on furnished state of path is always on top in their entire life of journey***
