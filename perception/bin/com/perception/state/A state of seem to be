A state of seem to be(‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ)
=====================================
Nigher any things is in fixed/static state nor it should be look like. The state of everything is in running/is in being mode forever.
The state of everything is for just a moment, it may be possible we realize some sate since long time but the same one will be vanish(transformed into another state) after certain period of time.
If you are able to inject your observation in a state that you have been realizing from long time, you can detect/observe the transformation is in running mode in that state also.

If you dig continuously a state of anythings layer by layer, you finally reach into a state streaming and after this point your observation tens to zero.

Every one feel a lot of things in their journey, some it may be adventurous or some what known for you.
When you feel adventurous due to new feeling your observation move to next zone and it try to observe/know the the state of feeling/execution behind the state/transformation behind it..so on.

when you accept the new feeling your observation move to next zone that welcome the current state of feeling.
At this state you realize something else new than your past experience. Now your observation move to next zone 
ie.. nothing but it seem to be.

Whatever you seems to be, that is noting but the current state of observation. It neither be fixed nor it should be look like fixed.
When you fixed at the state of seem, your observation jump into next zone known as seeming. Seeming is nothing but your realization get stuck some where on particular state
and you start realizing that this is nice/this is great/this is bad/this is truth/this non truth..so on.

The state of seem to be just for you experience/knowing the feeling at this state/to observe the changes chapping to reach on this state/to observe the transformation
happening at this state but never should be stuck at the sate of seems to be.

Whatever you seems to be, the feeling behind this either will be lost or will be decrease in their intensity after certain period of time but whatever you get experience it will be with you for that state of seems.

Ex-
-When you travel from village to city, you seems to be it is a great place for enjoy the life but after certain period time you again seems to be this is not peaceful place.
-When you travel form city to metro city the similar type you may realize.
-When you are in initial phase of meditation, you realize some what energetic and seems to be the life is great, but when you enter in next zone you feel more energetic and you
seems this is much great, when you move in next phase you realize your power of observation increase and you seems it is adventurous great for life,
When you move to next zone you realize the object in the form of stream, you realize the things not in the  form of object but in the form of state.
When you move into next phase you realize our realization tens to zero...so on

Whatever we seems to be that are nothing but the current state of feeling and that are in transformation state only.

***A state of seems to be is for observation/experience not for to get stuck there***
***Neither of the feeling is in its initial state nor it is in any destination state but it is in under transformation state forever***
***Neither any initial state nor any final state since everything's exists only in the form of transformation/steaming***
