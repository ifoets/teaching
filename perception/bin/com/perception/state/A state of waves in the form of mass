A state of wave in the form of mass
===================================
 We look object/object's activity every instance of time and we seems to be this object is doing this activity, Similar way we do many activity each and every time in our life and realize we are in process of doing.
 
 It is a perception of senses/mind who unable to detect the waves in the form of action because mind/senses are not in such a state that it can interact waves in the form
of action.
When mind transform into observation it state get changed then it is the observation not mind realize some thing else than just the mass in action.
 Observation realize the mass is in action but the it need support of waves/energy to do activity.
 
 When observation transform into realization then not the observation but the realization realize something else and look mass and energy are in consolidated form together
 and during action both are active for perform task.
 
When realization transform in to stream of energy then streaming realize some thing else and it first separate the mass and energy/waves completely and then it  realize waves is a complete form of energy and mass is just a dead collections of particles.
 
 Streaming realize not the mass but waves are responsible for 
 any activity and mass is just in support.
 
 Then why need mass if all action perceive by waves only?
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Mass is collections of particles and it is  unnatural/non streaming state without energy/waves that is against the existence/creation.
 Waves/Energy is also separately unnatural/non streaming state ie whom it make to stream ie mass only.
 
 -It is just like if Time exists without space,waves,mass. What will do this time, who need this time, ie why need time? These all query become nonsense right?
 -It is just like Space exists without waves/mass. Whom this space keep, who need space for its existence, the mass and energy need space for their existence.
 -It is just like wave exists without mass, Then whom this wave make into stream, It is mass only who need energy for streaming/transformation.
 
 ***Transformation/streaming is the existence of object***
 ***Every object(mass+energy) exists in the form of stream only, otherwise it break the nature/existence***
 
When an object transform into another object that is nature itself. Everything who exists must transform into another object it take trillion of light year or how much human
being can calculate the the time in long range that doesn't matter since it is existence only.

Mass alone never exists it is also against the nature since it never take part into transformation.
Mass need energy for transformation, mass and energy need time,space for its existence since mass/energy will need space for its existence and transformation in it.
Without time transformation have no meaning, it need time at any cost.

Why mass?
--------
You can observe without mass how universe look like, what wave do alone in this space, whom goes into transformation, Where will be force exists?..so on
Without mass nature is an imaginary stuff only and that is against the nature.
***Life exits in  the form of mass or energy it depends up our perception***
***Time, Space, Mass and Waves/energy are the base of existence or coexistence of nature***
