A storm on the surface of mind
=====================================
Mind is nothing but the bundle of thoughts/bubbles that arise on the surface of mind
and a storm on the surface of mind is nothing but the force on thoughts/bubbles.

Thought in mind is one thing and that thought are under storm is completely different things.

Ex-
It is just like creation, raising and explosion of bubble in pound.
It is very rare to see bubble on the surface of clean water.

When some reaction arise in dirty water that create the vacuum and due to light nature of vacuum
it moves on the surface of water and present in the form of bubble,
the surface tension on the surface of bubble try to keep bubble in stable state
but in storm the bubble exploit when the surface tension unable to sustain the same.

The thought and the storm in thought is somewhat similar to life cycle of bubble in water.

It arise in zigzag mind and every one suppress it to keep inside but after certain threshold
it come on the surface of mind and if there is some emotion that create the storm and finally
the thought comes out of mind through mouth in the form of words.
