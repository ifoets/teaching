A state of inclination
========================
Every state of energy get inclination towards the their higher state of energy for their stability and the same stability represent in the form of satisfaction when we look the 
stability of energy in the smooth perception of life.

It is obvious, it is natural, it just depends up on the state of energy within you who incline towards the first site of its stability. First site of stability means it incline 
towards the symmetrical higher state of energy.
Mind is the external state of energy ie, it is mask of life energy within us so it always incline towards world/relativity/confidence/knowledge/creativity of world/the lime
light of world/artificial existence of creation/fame/power/money/lust. This is state of mind, you cant control your mind directly to get inclination towards world other wise you get fight with transmission of waves by mind.

If You try to control your mind directly, you never get controlled over it, since it is doing its own task what it should be do but due to unawareness of state of mind you try
infinite time to control it and every time you get fail with gating stress during.
It is poor understanding of mind only who try to control the another state of mind. When you fall in lust your mind get signal of happiness and when another state of mind
realize the path is not feasible for it then it try to control the state of energy get transmitted during lust.

***It is one state of mind only who try to control another state of own mind, that is poor understanding of mind***

Why inclination towards the world
---------------------------------------------
When your mind gating shape(at age of 7-14), you gating many new things in your life, your mind gating awareness from the world and it try to grow in the world. When mind get
better shape (at age of 14-21) then it get stabilize in the world in their own ways. Stability of mind not simply get in single day but it gather log of knowledge/assumption
and it create its own believe system and this believe system drive the state of mind.

Your mind get unlimited number of layers in its believe system. When mind get a well stabilize form in this world then it create the lot of imagination and due that the feeling
in heart get created and this feeling provide dramatic support to your believe system.

Ex-
When you know you get born from this lady, you feeling automatically get connected with her. None know really they get born from whom but the world around you tell 
she is your real mother that is enough to connect your feeling.
Similar way your mind get born in this world it always gating inclination towards this world only. It is obvious.

***The energy in state of mind/surface of mind are exists in symmetrical state of energy flow on the surface of world***

So mind always gating engage in this world, Every state of energy need their symmetrical state of energy for their stability.

Ex-
-If you give diamond to hungry people what they will do, they can't it. The hungry state of body need food.
-If you teach religion to poor people they don't have any meaning of realization, they are hungry they need food only.
-If you teach spirituality to humans whose mind is completely engage in this world. What they will do with this spirituality, they need money/fame/lust/power. They need every
thing for stability of their mind only. Since their poor understanding realize it is mind who do every thing, they don't know the state of energy within them who do every activity.
-so on.

Inner inclination
---------------------
It is not easy for every one to incline towards within. They don't have even a dark believe system towards within. They don't have any clue through which they try to enter
within.

There might be the following reason that human get blindly incline towards within ie they get spark/clue through which they darkly try to enter within.

-Gatling pain since long time and their attention is to know the pain
-Staying in alone and silence
-Gatling influence by some spiritual human/their get touch by spiritual energy/waves
-Looking nature continuously and try to know the nature
-Simply practicing the meditation or breathing yoga or keep them self in silence
-Some one try to observe the thing in some special ways
..so on
The above statement is just a symbol of spark of inner energy and it try/making ready for inner journey.

But when any human get any concrete signal from within then they incompletely get incline towards within. When any human get incline towards within then an another world get created
within. Now they get drive their life form within. After practicing many years of meditation their mind get transformed into observation.
This is the state of observation who look the world in the form of energy/in the form of waves/in the form of streaming of energy/ so on.

***Inclination of energy towards its symmetrical state of energy and it is obvious only***
***It is not you but the state of energy within you(first site of energy) gating inline towards world***
