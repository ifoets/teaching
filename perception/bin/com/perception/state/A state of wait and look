A state of wait and watch/look/observe
=============================================
Normally every human put their strength to resolve their complexity in their life but some time they feel/seems to be the complexity have much strength than them then either run away or keep in a state wait and watch/look/observe..depends on their energy level.

Run away is nothing but a seeming inside seems to be, it create another level of seeming and complexity get covered by run sways state now complexity running in their attention
and run away state taking the lead using their seeming.

They unable to understand the following query.
-From how many places one run away? 
-Where there attention/mind is running in this state?
-From how many complexity one run? 
-Who ran away from their situation.
-What is the extreme state of run away?

-To fight there is only one complexity in front of us but for run away there are infinite path we seems to be and the same complexity get transformed into finding the better/best
path for run away.
If one fight they can get some  experience together with some happiness and pain.
If one run away they get some pattern when it seems to be some complexity in font of them their first site towards run away.

-To take aside from complexity is also one ways but this is also the nothing but the transformed form of run away only since in this state our attention always get pulled
towards complexity and trying to resolve internally but externally they make to realize others like they haven't any meaning in this complexity.
This state make them frustrated but here the frustration increase slowly here in compare to run away.

-To wait and look is for every one but mostly utilize by the human who have previous experiences of this state or who having some what good observation power.
If one use this state then when they decide to come in this state they make themselves ready to come near to complexity they neither try to run away no try to fight with complexity but they try to know what is this complexity.
That means they come close to complexity and after some time they realize it seems to be complex but fact is not the same.

when one come in this state there energy never get destroyed and this energy is enough to look inside/into the complexity.
At this state your time get decrease towards complexity and finny you get close to complexity and when we get close to any stuff our perception get transformed in to observation.
This observation is responsible to look the complexity from different angle.

This type of states used much more by spiritual human being since they get many scenario when they can't do any thing with their active emotions except wait and look.

***This is state of knowing***
***It is our poor understanding who makes/resolve the complexity***
***A good understanding human always fly with complexity only but they never seems to be complexity***
