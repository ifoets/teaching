A state of swinging life between two phase
==========================================
The states of energy have the power to change the state of any things. It is in the form of atomic fields/magnetic fields/electric field/mechanical state/liquid state fields/air state/
pressure or force state/compressed or expanded state/light or dark state/sound state/flag state ie on/off..so on or whatever the state of energy that is different things
but any things/every things changes their state due to energy supply/reduce/transform or increase/decrease intensity in that stuff.

ie means the energy are exists in infinite states and due to their states exists in infinite ways the mask of energy ie object also exists in infinite ways. Sine object is just
the mask(physical representation of energy) of energy.
Life is also a form of energy who have caliber some what different than the non life energy. But overall the life or non life is the states of energy.

Energy always are in some states but senses/mind detect/ realize this states in form of phases. Due to poor understanding of mind it read the same energy in the form of object.It understand the passe of energy at the place of state of energy.

The poor state of mind break the states of energy in two phases since it seems to be easy to understand/ assume/ relate/correlate/manage/calculate..so on..by the poor state of mind.

Ex-
1.
If you will tell to poor state of mind God is every where and it is controlling each and every things in this universe,  it is not only easy to assume but also it is easy to explain.
Here both source and destination are in easy to exchange the communication.

But when you will tell it is not the God but infinite state of energy who control each and every things in this universe then it is not easy to explain and it is not easy to under
stand by poor state of mind.
  
2.
When you tell a poor state of mind stress is negative energy and peace is positive energy then it is easy to explain and it is easy to assume by poor state of mind. but when you tell stress is the state of energy within you and peace is another state of energy within you then it is not easy to explain and it is not easy to assume.

***Whatever the assumption system injected/build in your poor understanding that only making/opening the path for further assumption***

When some one tell you keep away from negative energy then you simply running towards positive energy. Is is poor state of mind who divide the energy in two phase.

***Neither any energy is negative nor it is positive, but both are just the state of energy***

It is the poor state of mind who understand the following are different and one is better then others.
-Good  and bad
-Right and wrong
-Good human and bad human
-Peace and stress
-beautiful and ugly
-Success and failure
-Rich and poor
-Honest and dishonest
..so on
If you run towards one shore of energy it make you flow and finally transformed into illusion/stress indirectly and if you run towards another shore of energy then it makes you stress directly.

Where you will go..simply swinging entire life between two phases/shore of energy.
You have to supply sufficient energy within you to understand your poor understanding first that makes a world of assumption/believe systems.
Your assumption/believe system makes/keeps in poor state of streaming.

Why any human divide the infinite states of energy in two phases?
----------------------------------------------------------------
It is due to ease of understanding/assumption for every one. A great state of observation can't explain the energy in the form of states of energy since a poor state of mind
not realize the energy itself how they can understand/realize the infinite sates of energy.
So Even a spiritual person can't explain the infinite states of energy and they also divide the infinite states of energy into two phases.
They don't have any option to explain the infinite states of energy.

They give you greed for sparking in you by dividing the states of energy in tow phases. Since poor state of mind can't get easily sparked.

***If you move on completely dark path then you have something base that keep your movement at least at the breaking the first threshold***
***Swinging of live is not enough to understand the state of energy***
