A state of transformation the Imagination to Observation
================================================= 
The power of human brain energy system works on around imagination, thinking, Analysis and Observation. These functionality directly depends up the state of energy running within us. Every human being have certain state of energy running within them and due to that state they imagine , think, analyze and observe the stuff differently. The electric energy
within every lives are as it is and it for just sustain/running the entire body system smoothly.

Every human being have some power of imagination , thinking, analysis and observation. Wherever our brain get more vibration there it get more reaction and that part get more develop. 
Ex-
It is just like you have certain energy(money) and you have to invest on 4 stuff but you will invest more on particular item where you feel to receive more stability. Similar way if you feel more stability by imagination/thinking/Analysis/Observation then your brain will be engage more in imagine/think/analyze/observe the stuff and your that part will be more advanced then other rest of functionality.

Observation to Imagination
--------------------------------------
At child age human observe the stuff rather than imagine/think /analyze. Since at child age every thing is new for them and new stuff always comes first under observation. They try to know what is this, they try to know why it working like that, they try to look in different angle, they to look and observe as many possible ways. After observation the brain of child get certain information about the stuff and it feet stored in brain energy system. When their  brain system get fully developed around age of 7-14 then they get the power of imagination/ thinking/ analysis the stuff properly. This time their brain do these activities on the stored information.

***Imagination/thinking/analysis required certain input/ information for processing***
***New stuff always comes under observation either you are child or young***
***At child age the energy in observation only get distributed/ transformed in Imagination, thinking, Analysis, Observation at young age***

Imagination have certain direction for processing the stuff, it differentiate/integrate/construct/destruct .so.on the information stored in brain system. The brain imagine in the direction where it realize it will get more energy later it get stress/complexity/tight bounding/rigidity..so on that is due to lack of observation.Brain always stored the stuff that it require later in use. You cross many shops in city but if are a non vegetarian and you like it much then automatically the chicken shop location get stored in your brain.
Imagination always ct in dark attached with some information and try to pull it in light that is in-line state. You can't imagine the stuff if you don't know anything about it. 

***Direction of flow of energy always towards its stability***
***Brain is also an energy system and it process(imagine/think/analyze/observe) in the direction where brain/heart ie entire body system get more stability***

Imagination to Observation
---------------------------------------
Activation of energy is easy than its arrangement, you can easily get angry, tens, emotional than to convert these into arranged state.You can destroy easily but the construction of same many take much more time. When the state of energy(Observation) at child get distributed into Imagination, thinking, Analysis and Observation at young age then it is very difficult to again transform these energy into Observation.

When a YOGI do yogic activities like YOGA/MEDITATION/ SILENCE/STAYING IN ALONE.so on, they activate their state of energy(Imagination, thinking, Analysis and Observation) after
activation due to continuity of their activities the activated energy tens/flow/transform towards single direction. Due to single direction of flow of energy they experiences the stuff newly. Whatever they look they realize it is new and new stuff always come under observation. This is the ways they try to observe the things as per his state.
If one observe the things then their power of observation get increase automatically in fact the distributed energy(imagination, thinking, analysis and observation) getting transform towards observation.
At this state you may realize like child, you may realize you don't have power to fight, your energy not support more to remember the stuff, collect the information, think,analyze, imagine..etc since you distributed energy get transformed into observation. At this state you may look life in different angle. In fact due to light  state of energy running within you, your perception get changed and due to change in perception  you look the object in the form of energy and that is new for you so Observation take a role here. 
In  fact at this state you realize more energetic with Observation rather than imagination/thinking/analyzing the object/energy/situation hence Observation taking lead for first  point of action and hence other activities like imagination/ thinking/analyzing get diminish. 

In fact get transformed.

***Your right hand get first point of action since you use it more***
***Observation at child state is for collection the behavior of object***
***Observation for YOGI is to know/look the internal flow of energy/state of energy***
