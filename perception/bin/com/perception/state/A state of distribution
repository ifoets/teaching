A state of distribution
=================================
Every human being distribute something in their life time to time. Distribution not means only to gives something to some one but also means to share something to someone.
We can observe many things/exchange of energy during distribution, we can observe better feeling or much better feeling, satisfaction..so on.

Distribution can be divide in tow state

1. Shared distribution
In this type of distribution source doesn't give stuff completely to destination but it share object/ energy/ emotion/ suggestion..etc to balance the destination.
In this state of distribution happen between two known humans.If this distribution happen on the surface of mind it create a wave for an instance and mind get engaged in its happiness.
If this distribution perceive on/in surface of heart it create a wave that give satisfaction to both of them.
If the same distribution perceive on the base of observation, the purpose to observe the energy exchange and get satisfied.
If the same distribution perceive on realization then it get fly in satisfaction.
If the same distribution perceive on streaming of energy it just take light to share.

***This type of exchange of energy perceive between known humans and bound named between them know as friend***

2. Complete distribution

In this type of distribution the humans not give more value to the stuff/object that going to be distributed but rather than they give more value to energy that they receive.
In this types of distribution not simply come but when one distribute many times then they get healing in their satisfaction and they observe it is much more importance of life.
After certain period of time the same feeling of satisfaction make some arrangement and then you realize you have much more stuff to distribute.
Your power of getting collect the stuff/object and the feeling to distribute the stuff/object both increase day by day.

complete distribution to completely unknown humans
----------------------------
This type of distribution is just like adventurous, Before distribution you mostly observe they will receive the stuff/objects.
One of the fantastic observation in this scenario is that the person either take or refuse the stuff/objects but they never refuse the love/affection injected into object. Even they refuse to take the object but they always receive the love/affection and you can observe the same on their face and smile.

When you distribute the stuff/object/energy..so on the stuff/object is just the interface and how much you inject your love/affection behind the distributing object that much smile only you can observe the smile on their face.
Smiling of their face is nothing but they returning back your energy with some additional energy instantly.

***Distributing to unknown person is very light since it is useful for observation, mind never come in picture here*** 
***Whatever we should distribute, we should inject our maximum love/affection into them***
***Every one distribute only their love/affection indirectly in the form of object***
