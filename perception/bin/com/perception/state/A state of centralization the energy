A state of centralization the energy
====================================
Energy is the soul of doing each and every action it means not mass,space,time are meaningless but energy take the support these stuff to keep itself in state of streaming.  
Not only the amount of energy but also its state/intensity/density..so on are taken into consideration for doing any action. The distributed form of energy is not sufficient
to many of required action specially drilling into within. It need not only the centralization of energy but also it need very high intensity.

Whatever you doing in your life is nothing but centralization of energy only ie.. purpose behind doing any action is nothing but centralization of energy. It is either external
(proper engagement of senses/mind) or internal (engagement of observation with streaming of energy/waves).

Why a state centralizer the energy
---------------------------------------------------------
Before understanding this you can realize following query

-Why you need beautiful wife, what is hidden inside beauty?
-Why you need better/stable/cool/peaceful family for marriage? What is hidden in your wishes for the same.
-Why you secure your future financially? What is hidden in secure future?
-Why you need well furnished house? What is hidden in furnished house?
-Why you need education in different field?
-Why you need healthy relation with your closer? What is hidden behind this?
-Why you need knowledge? what is hidden behind knowledge?

If you have any of above wishes with you then you can sit and just try to realize honestly the purpose/center of above wishes, you will realize many things but the center of all the 
above query to maintain the smoothness of your external life(the mask of life). If you will get above wishes in your hand then our mask of life get smooth it not provide any
valuable changes in your internal life.

***Smoothness of external life(mask of life) may realize lack of satisfaction***

Smoothness of external life is much important if you want to go within at least for initial state. If you fight for your basic needs/love/respect/feeling then you will be 
engage here only and you never realize the central purpose of you life.

***distributed form of energy is not meaningless but it not provide you valuable changes in your life***

External life
------------------
It is the central search of every instance of energy to reach/move/flow towards their stability, it is external or internal energy doesn't matter, the matter is to stabilize its state.
Stabilization of state of energy by either by collecting the more and more energy or by increase the intensity of energy.

Ex-
-Saving the money for future, securing your business/securing you job so on are nothing but centralization of financial energy.
-Making the good relation with your closer/respecting the closer/taking care the closer..so on are nothing but increasing the intensity of you mask of life.

Internal life
-----------------
Internal life is completely away from the external source in the matter of increasing the intensity of energy or to increase the internal energy. The process of centralization
of internal energy is by practicing meditation/breathing yoga/silence/..so on.

Why you practicing the meditation?
Is is nothing but activating the abstract energy and centralization the same for the purpose to stabilize the internal life.

***External life is completely depends up the internal life ie state of streaming of energy within***
State of centralization of energy is nothing but stabilization of energy, gathering of energy. There are some purpose to centralization of energy, it never without any purpose.

***Without centralization of energy, energy itself can't take the valuable structure/waves/steps***
