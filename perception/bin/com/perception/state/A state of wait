A state of wait
====================
Every one get crossed form this state in their life. Before understanding of wait, first will try to understand who wait? and for whom wait?why need to wait?

A state of Waiting state take birth when two person/(or a person and another object/activity/action) try to come close each others.
Or keep our interaction live for further moments.
Or at least exchange instant exchange of energy

If you have little good observation you can minimize the state of wait.
Ex-
If X tell first time to Y will come in 10 min and X came in 20 min and 2nd time also X tell will come in 15 min and came in 30 min
Then Y should observe their pattern and when next time X say will come in 5 min then Y should understand 5 min of X means 10 min for me.

Who wait?
------------------
You wait mean normally you need/give some energy from/to whom you wait, If you don't need any exchange of energy from some one then you
never wait ie.. no any waiting state exists without exchange of energy.

For whom we wait?
------------------
That is suppler of energy or lack of energy who are ready to exchange(give/take) energy, either they ready to take or ready to give.But should be in state of ready.

Wait for some one with suppressing waves
-------------------------------------------
In this state of wait, waiter concentrate what they need, what others will get this is out of mind for waiter.
This is the state wait taking meaning in fluctuation of energy from top to bottom and from bottom to top.

Wait each for each other
------------------------
This is a state of wait when both side trying to understand each others. Both try to supply energy to each other before meeting.
This state start with co understanding between them. In this state both waiters realize similar in level of energy.
In this state both are in a state together that seems to be provider of energy to each other.

Wait for yourself
------------------------
This is a state of for whom, who play with self, the person are in a state who try to interact with inner self.
This state arise when human get fluctuation in their emotions but their understanding/observation make them in waiting state.
This is nothing but wait and look state of waiting.
In this state emotion rarely get suppressed and human try to keep them self closer and closer with their observation/emotions.

Flow of waves/energy/emotions in external waiting state
------------------------------------------------------ 
This cover (Wait for some one with suppressing waves/emotion)
let us X is waiting Y
.
Since X need energy from Y and waiting to Y.
The emotions/waves of X get activated for receiving energy from Y for what amount 
Y is ready to supply.
If waiting time increase then the same emotions/waves ask amount of energy for which it get activated to form some shape for its stability.
X never supply since if X have capability to supply then with that activation only X provide to its waves/emotion.
From this state we start feeling bad because of unsuitability of our emotions/waves and when Y come to meet X
X get sudden/quick happiness since X get energy from Y and the activated energy/waves get stabilize.

***Wait and look is most suitable state of wait since in this state we diminish the time and close to self***
