      A state of 3-D transmission of energy within human
===============================================
Each and every system that we see/observe/realize/touch in our day to day life that get constructed by different state of energy and object. These systems behave differently due
to the state of energy and their arrangement are different within these objects. Your eye are properly constructed/ programmed to see in light, your nose programmed to smell. Even eye and nose have almost same weight/mass but their behavior are completely different and these difference is due to energy programmed within them.

We have many part in our body system and they work differently than each other sine they programmed(arranged the energy) differently within them.  100 gm mobile work in different way than 100 gram sound box because both are programmed for different things.

Human body system have many-many points for transmission of energy back and forth with an external object. But mainly the senses get into consideration from where brain get 
disturbance(the vibration in brain energy system). These senses are just an interface for brain. It is just like sound box is an interface for emerging the sound waves, screen
of an computer is just an interface to write/read or look something there.A website is just an interface for work..etc
But the actual work get done in backed from where these interface are get controlled.

Ex
-You eye focus on some object, but your brain looking into that object since it get controlled in brain system, eye is just focusing on object nothing else
-You can enter anything in a website but these parameter get controlled by backed server form where the website is running.

Similar ways the energy within body get controlled by 3 different energy system within our body and they have their own dimension for transmission of energy.

3-D transmission of energy within human
------------------------------------------------------
These 3 different state of energy system are brain, heart and observation.

Brain(very fast transmission)(like steam, very disarrange)
--------------------------------------
It use the senses as an interface to face the object. It is programmed in such a way it have caliber to think. When your sense is open your brain automatically think something
it may be light or complex depends up the state of energy running within you. Due to power of thinking it analyze the object in different way for its purpose. The way of analysis
depends up the power of attention. At the time of analysis the energy within heart system is also active and same time it feel light/heavy, good/bad..so on but the feeling must
be in two part.
The Interfaces of brain is senses and senses are capable to touch the mass part of energy system so brain is also work on the activities of mass of part of an energy system.
Or it work on energy system where mass is an interface for that energy system.

Ex- As a website is an interface, whatever input user can give the backed server can work on that input only, it not take input from sky.

Heart(liquid energy from brain system or observation)(like water)
--------------------------------------------------------
Any waves/energy/energy system get disturbance(base point of any reaction) when it either receive/transmit energy with external source. Heart get energy from brain or from
inner being system(from top or bottom) or by observation.
When it get energy from brain(brain get energy through imagination/senses, senses get energy through mass or activities of mass), it will work on that energy only, it can't 
receive energy form sky.
Heart never feel light through energy get received from brain since input is junk here.It either feel good or bad but never light here. 

***Seed is the base point of tree***
***Heart either feel good or bad when it receive energy from brain***
***The feeling of good & bad realize the existence of an energy system as human***
***Mass is virtual/visible state of energy within and energy within is real/actual state of mass***

Observation(light, thin, solid and slow transmission)(like ice)
-------------------------------------------
Observation is neither a thinking nor an feeling. You can feel either by thinking or by observation. Observation also use the senses but it not engages with only the activities of an object but it penetrate/drill the state of energy within that object. Observation receive the activities of object in the form of energy within object not just the activities of object on its surface. In Other words activities of mass is an interface of streaming of energy within mass for observation. 
Since observation receive energy from within object and brain receive energy form mass/surface of object there state of receiving energy are different. You may observe, when
you observe something where is your attention and when you look something where is your attention. You can realize your attention is interested in mass/activities of mass when
your brain is in action and your attention is interested in activities of object/state of energy within object when objection is in action.

***When you observe you feel light or it may realize you not feeling anything***
***When you think, you feel good or bad it may realize you not feeling anything***
***Your existence is hidden in core part of feeling like good or bad***
***In observation activities of mass/energy is seeds and in thinking mass/activities of mass is seeds***
