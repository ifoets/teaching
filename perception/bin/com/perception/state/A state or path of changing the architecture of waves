A state or path/shape of changing the architecture of waves
===============================================
Not only the waves/ atoms/molecules/ elements/ object/ actions/ activities/ thought/ emotion/ perceptions/ observations/ realization/ understanding/streaming of energy/waves..so on
but also the entire universe follow a particular architecture in their every transformation.

Whatever the things from where we cross in our entire life having less or more energy in us that all things always use/follow a particular architecture during their transformation.
If we observe in deep layer of the state of transformation we can realize every stuff start transformation when it get sufficient energy for start  transformation
and during journey on transformation it collect more and more energy and this process reach to extreme state of transformation ie that is the most stale state
of transformation, at this state object/energy are in most stable state and their arrangement/architecture is in their perfect shape.

When the object/energy reach to its max stable state then it break the threshold and start to transform into different architecture.
Before move towards another arrangement of waves, the intensity of waves reduce to certain level and due to low intensity the previous arrangement of waves get destroyed and from this point the energy start to make new architecture of waves if it get the sufficient energy it again reach to their most stable state and again go through above process.

Ie means the waves/architecture of wave/object construction/object destruction/..so on follow a specific design
during transformation from one form to another form.

let us consider a,b,c,d,e,f..are some stable state of some waves architecture.
and let us consider Min and Max are state of waves architecture/arrangement/design stability.

It follow a path like
a(min)-a(max)-a(min)-b(min)-b(max)-b(min)-c(min)-c(max)-c(min)..so on

We can describe it more better, if you observe the above series it follow a special path

a(max)->[a(min)<=>b(min)]->b(max),
b(max)->[b(min)<=>c(min)]->c(max)

this is just like the below pattern

-           -
 -        -
   -    -
     - -
     - -
    -   -
   -      -
  -         -
 -            -
Max-Min-Max
 This is nothing but just like drum/Damru(डमरू).
 
Why every waves/architecture of waves follow this(Damru) shape during its transformation.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Since every state of object/energy have affinity to reach its maximum stable state
 When it reach to its maximum stable state its internal wave arrangement have get it perfect shape and from here there is not next point to stabilize more
 So it break the threshold and return back in low intensity to again reach different stable state.
 And due to this back and forth of energy transformation only the object/energy change their shape/size/color/elements..so.

 It is nothing but the base of existence of nature and due to this only nature seems to be colorful.
 
 Ex-
 When billion of birds fly together in a group, you can observe a group make many shape/waves during their fly,
 You can observe they create one shape of waves when its shape get maximum stability it might they fly some time 
 in same shape but after certain period of time they break the threshold and try to arrange/design some different shape/waves during their fly.
 
 ***It is the nature/existence of energy/ waves/ stability/ transformation that make Damru(डमरू) during their transformation form  one form to another***
