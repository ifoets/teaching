 A state of problem
 =================================
 Every human face many problem in their day to day life.They try to resolve these problem based on some priority.
 If they get stuck completely with the problem then their first priority to resolve the problem quickly.
 If they can move with problem then their priority to resolve the problem decrease automatically or they keep aside for a moment.
 
 Many times they suffer lot to resolve the problem and many times they get some clue to resolve quickly.
 
 When humans realize there are many problem in their life, Many of them deal all problems at a time and many of select the highest intensity problem that gives more tension.
 Many of them look on a particular problem that is just in front of them.
 
 If one try to resolve all problem at a time they obviously they get tens since their energy of attention get distributed in different direction.
 If one try to resolve a problem that is in front of them then they get little tense since their attention is centralize on a particular problem.
 
Is really human have problem in their life?
There are infinite answer for above query since there are infinite angle of approach towards any stuff/things.
Here one going to describe only two answer Yes and No

Yes:-
Yes there are many problem in human life. Why one realize this, This is due lack of understanding about circumstance in front of them.
Due to poor understanding one realize the circumstance/problem is like an enemy in front of their life and without killing this enemy they cant service.
This is one of the poorest angle of approach towards the circumstance and circumstance look/realize like a problem. If one think the problem/enemy in front of them is more powerful then them,
It is impossible to resolve/fight with it then their direction of thought change the direction and they try to find the path from where they run away with high speed
then this problem become complex/critical/painful for them and finally they realize this enemy is nothing but wound of their life.

***Your angle of approach towards any stuff completely depends up on the energy level in you/state of energy in you***

No:-
If one look the circumstance like a situation then the same problem realize differently and the same problem realize 
like this not a problem for their life but this is a situation in front of them and they have to take care of it.
In this situation they not fight to resolve but they engage with the situation and taking easy to resolve the same lightly.

***The angle approach change a problem into situation****
***A problem is just like to fly in new/unknown/adventurous type of sky and take a new experience of fly***

Not at all:-
If one look the situation like scenario then the same situation realize differently and it look/realize like this is not a situation but it is just a scenario and they are only responsible 
to take care of this scenario.
If your angle of approach is more conscious then the same scenario realize like this is not a scenario but this is just a new game and they have a chance to play it and they realize if they don't play then they loose a chance to enjoy/learn with new game. They realize this is up on them to play or leave but they don't want to miss to play the new game in front of them.

***The angle of approach change a circumstance in to problem->situation->scenario-> a new game***
***There are many problem in your life or no any problem,It just depends up on the angle of approach towards any circumstance***

***If the angle of approach is light the stuff become light automatically***
