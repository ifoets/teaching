A state of valuable energy
===========================
Each and every lives are in search of energy/stability/healing at each and every moment of life, this process run entire life. Each and every lives have different types
of requirement of energy.
Ex-
Except the lives of human other lives need food and affection, even without affection it is in good state of streaming. But in case of human being it is not enough because of the possibility in the transformation of its state towards stream of energy.

In case of human being we collect different types of energy but we unable to recognize where it get used and which part/state of our lives need which types of energy.
If one recognize by its by experiment on self then they can understand the value/meaning of different types of energies and their purpose.

Except human lives
---------------------------
Others lives except human being also have senses/mind/observation/realization..so on, but these senses are in not in such a state that penetrate in object/energy after certain limit/ threshold because of low intensity of their senses(normal/usual senses) their attention get created is also have low intensity.
Because of low intensity of their attention they not engage in world as human get engaged.

***It is not the human/birds/tree/animal but their attention waves/energy get engaged in world***
***Animal/birds create usual waves that normally complete their cycle***

Human being
--------------------------
Human being is a special lives and the base of their specificity is due to their senses are in different state than others lives, and because of their attentive state of senses a attentions get created and the state of attentive attention the attention can penetrate in object/energy in different angle/approach, because of their attentive attention their thinking power get created.
And because of higher state of thinking power than others life, human create many waves and due to lack of energy these waves not always fulfill/complete their cycle.
The above state of the attentions of human being they need/require special set of energy to maintain the life cycle of the waves get created in their life.

Types of energy required by human lives
--------------------------------------
Food:
It is used for body mainly, the types of food valuable for you health,it is different thing that when body is live others part of body also in active state.

A thinking towards solution/completion of waves
--------------------------------------
This types of thinking exercise of your mind, realizing their power of thought

Entertainment
---------------
This is just freshness of mind, or keep mind in current state/streaming state/keep away towards burn of energy.

Yoga(breathing)
-------------
This types of energy not only create the sufficient energy for blood circulation but also it start to touch the base of invisible energy/observation.

Meditation
-------------
This activity collects/summarize the distributed attention towards a single, It is just like different birds(waves) flying alone here and their, ie as a group their is no any
specific resultant, but when they fly together then all small waves get a new single structure of waves.
Similar way meditation also collect all the different distributed waves into a single waves structure and due to single waves/structure it have capability not only to 
create the wave but also naturally it complete the cycle of waves.

Silence
------------------
It use the waves that get create in meditation, in this state observation get in transformed into higher state and the higher state play with waves get created by meditation.

***Lives is also a wave get started with birth and it complete cycle with death then ready for further structure/cycle of waves/lives***
