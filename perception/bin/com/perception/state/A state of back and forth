A state of back and forth
=========================================
There are many scenario come in front of us during journey. If we look the scenario in the form of problem the same time 
certain thing in mind get activated towards finding the solution.
If we feel some pressure from our boss/ family/ society/ closer..so on.. to solve the problem, the time we feel pressure our mind get activate in another direction to overcome this pressure first, mind start looking some clue that can reduce pressure quick as much possible. Due to lack of patience mind use hit and trail way to reduce pressure
Up to this state mind burned lot of energy in finding the instant clue to reduce their pressure. If still pressure exists in mind it means mind get exhausted during finding the clue and due to burning of energy the way of looking towards the stuff have been changed. Hence we look the same stuff/pressure in serious mode that again exhaust the rest of energy in mind. Up to this state fear born in us and that realize something going to be wrong and hence we come in the state of stress.

At this state we are in very low state of energy, whatever we do/whatever we look/whatever we think/what ever we understand/what ever we realize/whatever
decision we take/what ever we speak/whatever we listen..Our main purpose hidden in above activity to just reduce the fear instantly. 

If we observe lightly, we can realize how energy get change their state with continuous burning of energy every moment.

Ex-
Initially there is no problem ie zero(0)
-Ve sign express here the lack of energy/lower intensity state of energy

step 1:- realize some problem(-1 ie poor approach) ie zero->(transformed to)-1
step 2:- Due to feeling pressure to resolve the problem we again burn our energy(-1) ie -1->(transformed to)-2

step 3:- Due to lack of patience we try to reduce pressure quickly and again we burn some part(-1) of rest of energy ie -2(transformed to)-3

step 3:- Due to low state  energy fear start born and that reduce energy again to overcome the fear ie -3(transform ot)-4

step 4: Due to fear we feel something is going to wrong with us and get stress ie we again burn the rest of energy ie -4(transformed to)-5
so on...

We can observe how one form/state of energy get transformed into another form/state of energy with lost/get with another state of energy.

Ex-
poor observation transformed into problem,problem transform in to pressure, pressure transform into fear,fear transform into stress
fear transform in to stress..so on. and these transformation in the same direction due to continuous burn of energy in same direction.

***Our experience/observation/decision/surrender may break the continuous burning of energy at some intermediate****

On the path of transformation form cool(0) to stress(-5) we can look many new path at every moment of time form where we can stop the continuous burning of energy.
And due to our mind is in suspicion state during above transformation path many times we move on new path and many times we return back to same point ie old path.

This is nothing but the back and forth state of mind. There are many points from where we stat new path and due to lack of understanding we return back to on old path.

***Neither any path is wrong/bad nor any path is right/good, But due to creating/burning the energy we get heal/stress so it realize/look like right/wrong or good/bad****

*** Mind get in state of stress at very last stage before that we play much more bullshit/hell  game with it***
