A state of transformaton of energy/Mechanism behind transformation of energy
=============================================
In each and evrery object/particles..weather it look like live or dead the state of energy/intensity of enrgy/streaming of energy inside it play the game.
if the intensity of energy increase/decrease inside the object the object get tranformed into another object in our first site of vision.
Before increase/decrease the intensity of energy firt it should be come in active state then only the intensity of energy increase/decrese depends up the pattern it follow.

Ex-
When a million of birds sitting in pond they indenpently searching thier food, ie they are active in alone and they are in inactive state with each other in a grop as single
unit,but when they start flying together first they all fly together without follow any pattern ie they all fly in zig zag move, this is nothing but active state of
a grop of birds together.
When a grop of acive mode of birds decide to fly in certain direction they same mode get transformed in to anothe state and follow some pattern during their fly, this is also
an active state of energy but it in transformed state ie following a pattern that creat certain wave and that wave flow in certain direction.

Before transformation of energy firt we look, is these energy in active state or in inactive state?, If you feel lazy/week/depressed/loose in confident
..so on, then your energy is in inactive mode it is not in a state to transform directly to make some pattern, before that you have to make it in active state.

When you feel much aggresion/angry/joules/lust/frustation/active..so on then your energy are in active state but in disarranged state ie not flow any pattern so
 at the palce you can use it in certain direction the same one energy use you in certain diretion and you just flow with it.
 
***Every human being have same energy but it is in diffrent state***

Due to differnce in state only they realize differently or their approch is different.

If your energy is in active state then you can trasfer it in nex state by arraning is in prticular phasion. When your energy reach in particulr phasion then its intensity get
slightly get increase.
ie From here if we supply contineuos energy then there will be a time come where energy start bombading on our abstract ennergy hidden in us only.
When our abstreact energy get activated then we feel complelty diffrent than past.
Simiilar way if supply more and more energy to us, our next level get activated and this processs/transformation get continued to activating the diffrent levels of abstract/sleeping
enegy inside us.

During this transformiton we realie many things like initially we are in loose/leazyweek/depressed state and after many transfomation we feel every thigs is fine every where.
We realize initially we was interested in object, then we start interst in internal behaviour of object again we start interset in flow of energy and finally our interest
in streaming of energy and from here we realize tending to zero...so on

We realize lot of things that cant be express in words but we can live these things in our life.

***Meditation/breathing yoga/silence are the one of the best source to supply continues energy to ourself***
