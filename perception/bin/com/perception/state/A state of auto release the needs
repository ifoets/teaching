=============================================
Every one having needs in their life. It is not only depends up on your understanding for your need but also it depends up on  you capability.
If your understanding is poor and capability is high then you realize lot of things for survival of your life. In fact many of them are not require 
for survival of your life but it look seems to be.
Due the lack of understanding you gather many things around your self. When you gather many things around you, your state of mind move in 
next zone and they realize it has spent lot of energy to gather the things so they want or not want, they try to use it. When you not gating
 any test to use your collected need later then you will not distribute your objects in your circle but you will try to find the space for your
  needs/objects. When you get the space to keep your object/needs, your mind move in next state and it realize it is not use for you right now, 
  but it will be useful later.

Have you been observed when you take space/interest in object at the same time the same object take space/interest in you too.

***Not only you need the objects but also objects need you too together, this is nothing but the bound between you and object***

When your understanding become little high, you can observe your requirement is very low. At this state of mind even many object is in front
 of you for use but you will use only the specific one. You realize the extra objects with you pulling you to engage with hems. 
 At this state of mind you automatically realize many of objects.Your realize these objects are not come under your needs and you distribute these objects in society.

At this understanding you can realize due to these unlimited need only your wings feel weight/pressure during fly.
Then your need automatically goes away from you since your interest get loose to keep unlimited needs/objects.

At this state your mind search to survive/fly with minimum number of needs, this happen lightly.
And hence it release all the extra needs without any purpose ie just release them automatically.This is nothing but a state of release the needs.
When you release the needs then you feel some what more light and you realize your wing open more lightly to fly in life.

If you force to minimize your requirement/needs, it can get minimize but later you will come on the same track since you don't understand the mechanism behind the unlimited requirements.

***You need to understand the internal mechanism of any thing then only it become light automatically otherwise it will be in tight state forever***
