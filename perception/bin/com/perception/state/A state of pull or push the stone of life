A state of pull/push the stone of life
=========================================
Life is nothing but it's all bout your understanding towards your self. If your understanding is light with life, you automatically fly/flow with it.
If your understanding is poor, you automatically fight with your self. You want or not want is different matter, the matter is realization/understanding/the energy in you.

If you don,t have understanding up to certain threshold then life is look like a stone in front of you. You never realize life is like a bike.
With poor understanding you want or not want, you always try to push/pull the stone.
You realize problem is stone in front of you and you also realize solution is nothing but push or pull this stone. Pushing or pulling the stone/life is nothing but
fighting with your self.
If you are some what more intelligent then you can pull/push life in better way, your ways of pulling/pushing never help you to understand life is not the stone.
Your approach/attitude/the way of looking will change automatically with increasing the level of energy in self.

If you fight to know, to recognize, to understand then you wont push or pull since analysis/understanding will always help to drive the life,
in fact before push/pull you realize/analyse what I am doing with self.

***A state of realization automatically drive life, not you or me***

If you have certain level of observation, you can realize life is just like a spot vehicle.
Your task to fill the petrol and try to know how to ride it. When if you have sufficient energy/petrol and if you know how to ride the vehicle/life, you can fly/flow with it.

***Meditation not only use to create the petrol for you but also it support to know how to ride this vehicle/life***

After knowing how to drive your self, you have only one task just to fill the petrol continuously for drive.
You want or not want your life will be with you and you also will be with your life together.

***your experience is for you only it never work for other.***

***It is enough to fly inside, doesn't matter what is going on everywhere***
***Neither to express nor to explain it but just have to fly/flow with self***
