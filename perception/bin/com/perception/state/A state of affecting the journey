A Life within Life
====================================
Every life need different types of energy for their survival.
In fact every life create in the atmosphere that at least support their creation.
If the atmosphere support for their survival they survive after their creation or else they extinct.
After creation of lives, Lives start its own journey, they realize what they need for their survival.
The lives who need external support for their survival is nothing but the external state of life.

Ex-
Our body has its own life, it require air,water,fire,food,room,sleep..etc for its survival
Our mind has its own life that need permutation,entertainment,management,gathering,throwing..
etc for its survival.

Similar way there is a life within life who support the external life.How we do the external management for our survival similar way all the internal management have been done by the internal life.

Internal lives have their own process and its requirement is to just support the existence of external life.

Ex-
It is just like thermodynamics(internal life cycle of oil) who create the heat from oil and convert the heat energy into magnetic energy that rotate the pulley,
From this rotating pulley what people do that is external(external state of oil energy) work done, but their is a internal support for rotation of pulley.

Before/on/After every action of human body/mind/intellect there are many process execute and that execute by internal life only.
You are not doing anything maintain the temperature of body,
on your little attention your eye look, you think, you listen, you feel, you observe.
In fact these all thin done by internal life mind just come on
between internal life and life as a an interface.

***Observation decrease the space between internal life and life***
***Internal life is the base of life***
