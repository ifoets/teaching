==============================================
Every one get 24 hr in day and night. Every one utilize 24 hours based on their understanding o flie. Neither one understand they burning their time simply but Every one understand they utilizing their time.

In fact every one are doing best to utilize their 24 hours in their perception.
If every things going on smoothly in life then it is fine for every one.

***If one fly smoothly in their life at every moment of time,then they no need to dig anything in their life***

How the state of mind change their state in life just giving a very tiny scenario
-------------------------------------------------------
(A)One problem start when they gating stress in their life. 
(B)Another problem starts when try to find any quick solution of stress.
(C)Third problems start when they find some quick solution for time being/temporary.
(D)Fourth problem start when they forget they are in
 stress state just some moment before.
(E)Fifth problem starts when they look another human in stress state and they realize this is common
 for every one..ie means there is no any solution for this.(F)Sixth problem starts when they get agree to pull/push their life in that state.
(F)Seventh problem starts when they don't agree to some workout like yoga/meditation/silence..so on since they don't have time for this.
(G)eighth problem start when they are agree for yogic kriya and expect something quickly.
(H)Ninth problem starts when they believe they did the
 yogic kriya but unable get out of stress in sort period of time.
(I)Tenth problem starts when they realize/believe stress is wound of every human life and none of them out of stress.
(J)Eleventh problems starts when they believe and make their believe strong that even scientists get stress and they didn't find any solution for themselves too..so on

In above scenario A,B,C,D...I, J..so on are nothing but the state of mind going to lower to lower state in each situation.
The above scenario is just one direction for the movement of the state of mind. There are infinite similar scenario where human mind engage in mode of back and fort state.

If our state of mind rotate/making cycling in above states, we never realize/understand the value of time for self.
In above states human mind always engage to find some quick solution. In above scenario what ever we think/realize all are in heavy state.
Due to heavy state of mind always we unable to understand/ realize the magic of time for self.
So priority to give time for your self is always in least state, and hence we unable to find time for self.
At these state if by chance you want to find the time for your self and if you get time by chance then you will think what will I do with self.

***Finding time for self is nothing but giving space to fly yourself with inner self***
Ex-
It is just like you have to stay in city, but due to your poor understanding one day you went to jungle and you forget the path to return back to your city.
Next you running here/there and burning energy continuously. Next you enter in dense jungle and after certain period of time your state of mind become hopeless and agree to stay there in between the dangerous animal with fear and finally after another certain period of time you forget completely that you came here from city and this jungle is not right place to stay.

***Every one have time to fight with self but no one have time to sit with self***
***Unlimited romance you can do only with your self***
***Not only building your wing but also you spread your wing to fly when you have time for your self***

If you have not time for your self then you don't have time for others/or for action and whatever time you share with some one is poor state of time
ie you are with some one/or with some work but there is something in your mind like thread that running continuously in different direction, and that thread pull your some what percent of your attention.

***Until you do not find time for your self unless your healing/romance exists in dead state***
***If you don't have time for yourself then you are Needy by signature***
***It is very testy/romantic/healing to fining time for your self***
