Initial state of seeker((साधक की प्रारंभिक अवस्था)
====================================
If we observe day to day activity of our life we get many pattern on which we rotate.
These pattern created by us only, Every pattern has some meaning in life. These pattern can change our life or it can make our life hell it totally
depends up on what we do with these pattern.
If we are a light observer then we come on the pattern, experience it and move forward. 
If we are not a light observer then we rotate on these patter over long period of time.

There are many things come in front of us in our day to day life and there are many time our mind/heart require peace/silence.
Some time we try, some time we fail to keep our self in peace this is due to lack of energy in our self.

When we get stress then we get the thought how to overcome from this state. When we come out from stress, we forget how much we suffer just some time/day before.

But there is a state of mind when it come out from the state of stress but it never forget for the permanent solution of stress.
This is nothing but the state of seeker. This is the sate from where our attention start moving towards self.

This is the state from where a person conscious for meditation/yoga/silence.
This is the state from where our life start to take a shape in different ways.

***Initial state of seeker always try to stabilize there state in every time and situation***

This is the first step of journey that realize some solidity towards self.
When mind reach to this state, it automatically meditate.
Before reach to this state we break many threshold and feel free to meditate.

***Realization is one of the best approach to break the threshold***
