A Rhythmic state of action
=============================================
Every one live their life in different ways/perspective. Every one try to live smooth life and for this every one perform some action in their day to day life.
The external purpose of performing some action may be due to relativity of life but the inner purpose of performing some action is not for the same. The inner purpose of
performing some action is nothing but  to make the life smooth.

There are many perspective/approach/angle of performing action.
Many of us perform action on greedy mode.
Many of us perform action on attentive mode.
Many of us perform action on aggressive mode.
Many of us perform action on resultant mode.
Many of us perform action on alert mode.
Many of us perform action on future mode...so on.

***Action is the center of transformation but the intensity of streaming the action depends on the angle on which it get perform***

Every action look like action when there are some abstract energy hidden inside it in the form of hope/purpose/meaning/useful/healing..so on.
This is nothing but a state of performing action that need the abstract energy behind it.
Here abstract energy is noting but the fire/petrol who makes the action in live mode. If intensity of fire decrees/increase automatically the intensity of action decrease/increase.

***You do not perform any action but the abstract energy burning inside action that make you force to do the same***

But what happen when one perform some action without any abstract energy and the intensity of action is in smooth mode.
Can it possible?
Yes it can be possible.

When one unable to realize the purpose/hope/any meaning/useful/faithful/healing behind their action, they just perform the special action.
This is nothing but a rhythmic state of action.

Every one start some action with some abstract energy(greedy/need/hope/purpose/useful/faithful..so on) only, but when they are in rhythm to perform action the same
abstract energy transformed in to rhythmic state. At this state your mind forget to realize the abstract energy and completely centralize on streaming of action.
At this state mind unable to realize any purpose of action, it just flow/fly with action.

****(abstract energy) hope/ purpose/ meaning/ faithful/ satisfaction..so on only transform in to rhythm***

When your abstract energy is in state of bundle(hope/purpose/meaning/faithful/satisfaction..so on) you can realize it but when the same energy transformed into stream, you unable to realize it as abstract energy but same time you realize you are in rhythm of action.

***Rhythm is nothing but the stream form of abstract energy***
Ex-
You may observe the football player at some moment when they are in rhythm.
You may observe a person who fly kite in sky and the person is in rhythm of fly,
Many time they forget where he is and they may fall in well, they may fall from roof.

***Rhythmic state of any action is highly energetic****
***Meditation is in extreme state of Rhythmic action where mind is in active state but unable to realize anything***

When one practice meditation/yoga/silence from long time and when they are in rhythm, they forget the purpose/any meaning behind it, they just flow with these activities.

***Rhythmic state of action == action + rhythm( the transformed form of abstract energy (hope/ purpose/ meaning..co on)****
