                 A state of disturbance/vibration
===============================================
-What happen when you get/feel disturb, without any guidance your first attempt to get balance/comfort, Even you are in sleeping state if your body get disturbance it try/adjust to 
make itself comfort automatically.

-What happen when you throw a stone in static pond, the static water get disturb and making circular waves in decreasing order of amplitude and finally after some time the same
water come in previous state/comfortable state.

-What happen when  you throw a stone in many sitting birds together, they get disturbance and fly suddenly together randomly in zig-zag ways and latter they fly together by
making some wave structure.

-What happen when you get some tough situation in your life, you get disturbance and after passing some day/month you become cool like as you has cool before tough situation.

-What happen when you switch on your fan, the electricity reach to coil within fan the static electron within coil get disturbance and creating magnetic field and hence inner part of 
fan start rotating and fan too.

-What happen  when you become angry, you get disturb and after some time you become cool.

-What happen when you heart some one they get disturbance and after some days/month they become cool.

***The root of any waves is due to disturbance/vibration in their molecules/atoms/structures/shape/existence***

Each and every object/energy are exists in some state(collection of streaming) and they maintain their state until they get any disturbance(in their molecules/atoms
/structure/design/shape..so on).
It is just like Newton's fist law of inertia, if some object is in some state they stay in that state until some disturbance get supplied.  
In fact many known/unknown disturbance get arise in each and every object from within and external source and hence they get changed  time to time.

***In reality each and every object exists in streaming hence they also exists in disturbance/vibration***
***Vibration is the base of creation of waves, creation of waves is the base of streaming of object/energy***

We get many example of disturbance and due to that disturbance object/energy/molecules/atoms get vibration and making waves and this waves is responsible to change the state
of object/energy.

***Object means the external/visible structure and energy means inner/non visible structure of any stuff***
***Small small vibration makes waves in some fashion and they create big vibration***

You feel good/bad/pain/delight...you think/understand/realize/heart, you look/hear/touch..or whatever your activity is due to disturbance/vibration of energy within you.

In above example, it is not you, it is not water, it is not birds, it is not situation....so on but the energy within system get disturbed. It is not the object but the
energy within object try to maintain their suitable/max stable state, when the inner energy system of object get suitable state the object look like static.

***Each and every object not only exits transmission(velocity) and transformation(changing shape/size) state***
The center of transmission/transformation is due to streaming state of energy within object and hence
***Each  and every object exists in streaming of energy within/streaming of shape/size/structure***
Streaming of any object/energy is due to transmission of waves within that object and every waves get emerge due to disturbance in atoms/molecules hence
***Each and  object not only exists in transmission/transformation/streaming but also it exits in disturbance/vibration state***
***Each and every object is object form outside and it is energy from their within existence***
