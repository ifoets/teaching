A state of rigidity
=============================
When we get influence from energy/object then our mind trying to rotate there and it understand this is place/ activity /object/energy from where we can get energy easily.
By change when they again go closer to that object/ energy/ activity and they again get energy then they get some pattern to collect some energy from that object/energy/activity.
This happen because they unable to find better intensity energy than that one and since they get energy easily without doing any sufficient work out they never leave easily and finally transform into rigidity.

Similar ways when a yogi doing yoga/meditation/silence they gating sufficient energy form within and they also not come out from that state, in other words yogi injecting
day by day towards within since they gating more and more energy form within.

What do you mean by rigidity?
----------------------------
Rigidity is a feeling/understanding that expect energy from a particular source and they get stuck on that point. In state of rigidity every one having a feeling like rotation of feeling towards some source.

There are two state of rigidity
---------------------------------------------------------
External rigidity
-------------------------------
When we rigid with some external source, that source seems to be source of energy and we get stuck there, if we don't have some other source of energy till we keep rotating there.

Within capability
-----------------
When the external source is energy is within your capacity then you can absorb more and more energy and it will be become test less. Since external source of energy is not the
production center of energy it will not provide more and more energy.

Ex-
If you are crazy to buy some object/energy when you buy it from that day your craziness gating decrease day by day.Since it seems to be energetic before your reachability.
If you expect more and more energy then you will reach in a state of rigidity.

Beyond capability
-----------------
The object/energy is beyond your capacity then you look towards them when it provide energy and you mind rotate towards rigidity/get stuck and it try to follow the object/energy.
Ex-
When you get energy from live match, how much workout you put here, just open your eye when match is live. If you get energy from some batsman then you automatically become
fan of them. When they play well then you get energy and when they play poor you release the same energy. But you expectation here make you rigid to watch the live match.
Not only your mind wait but also it will be welcome before start the match.

***External rigidity play a role of separation you from within***
***When you are able to look the state of object/energy then you do the same thing but without rigidity***
***External rigidity need only connection/very small amount of work out, it create a tight bound***

Internal rigidity
------------------------------
Internal rigidity is different than external rigidity in terms of work out and centralization.
Here human completely depends on the central source of energy and for that they supply much energy and they get more and more energy day by day.
At very rare situation internal rigidity create pain(during transformation of state) but it get resolved by awareness easily since at this state one have sufficient energy.
At this state we aware about the state so one get rigidity from complete process not the state one.

***External rigidity makes boding tight whereas internal rigidity makes bounding light day by day***
***This is nothing but the game of energy and their intensity***
***External rigidity become stuck point where internal rigidity makes them healing day by day***
