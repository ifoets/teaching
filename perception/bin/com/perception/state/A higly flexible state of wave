A highly flexible state of wave
================================
Every moment of time whatever action( think/ feel/ observe/realize/understand..so on) perform the basic mechanism/design behind that is nothing but transformation/transmission of waves inside our body/senses/mind/intellect..so on.on the basis of that transmission/transformation we act/ express/think/ feel/ observe/realize/understand..so on.

You can observe physical activity/expression is nothing but representation of waves transmission/transformation, if you haven't sufficient energy then your focus
get in touch/interact with physical activities automatically but if you have sufficient energy then your focus get in touch/interact with waves transformation/transmission
automatically.

***The co state stuffs/waves/object interact automatically**

If you haven,t sufficient energy then you want/not want or whatever you try/force yourself to interact with waves transmission/transformation in body/mind/intellect
you can't interact since this is not you who interact the waves but the energy inside you interact internally and that energy is not in a state to interact the waves 
transmission/transformation in body/mind/intellect.
But if you have sufficient energy neither to try nor to force since they are in co state and hence they interact automatically.

Why Yogi/Spiritual human are normally in delight state?
--------------------------------------------------------
Every human being normally either in search of happiness/in happy state/ or search to reduce their sadness/or in state of sad.
This circular process run entire life just it changes their state. Yesterday You got happiness/sadness due to interface X, Today gating the similar happiness/sadness due
to interface Y and tomorrow you will get the similar stuff due to interface Z. The interfaces X,Y,Z are not different but their state are different and it make seems to be different
.There are infinite number of interface who make you seems to be different but they are just in different states and due to different states they look like different.

Yogi/Spiritual human have better/much better understanding of interface who changes their states and it seems to be different. Hence they search the some central unique interface 
from where they can take energy tremendously. They find that is within only and they start to utilize these energy by using their activities like Yoga/meditation/silence or any other 
activities. After certain period of time they get connection from within and after connection within they are reachable to the abduct source of energy.
Yogi use these energy to for practice their activities and finally their concentration transform in to observation.

***Yogi find the Central source of energy and due to reachable state they never feel lack of energy and hence they are in state of delight***
***Delight is nothing but we are in state of sufficient energy***

Since due to continuous supply of energy, their(Yogi's) energy distributed to their body/senses/mind/intellect/observation..so on having high density.
And after certain period of time energy/waves get/reach in such a state it can interact to another waves of many different frequencies easily/lightly.
Due to this state of energy/arrangement of waves within them, they take the thing light automatically.

This is state of waves architecture/arrangement within us that can interact lightly to another different types of waves having different state of similar frequencies.
This is nothing but highly flexible states of waves within us.

***At flexible state of waves where waves are light to interact with another waves easily/lightly***
