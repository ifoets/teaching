A state of thanking
=========================
All most all human get a state of thanking in their life many times. They may use the word thanking or wordless but they realize many times to thankful to another humans/
object/nature/energy/lives..so on.

Mechanism behind thanks
-------------------------

External world thanking
-------------------------
When your energy withing you are just capable to execute some task/activities and you generate/create little or more energy to execute it smoothly. Since during executing the 
task only you generate energy more and more and your attention to execute the task not but unable to look the changing of state(energy level), When your task get executed
successfully then your state of attention get change form executing the task to collected the energy and you feel too much fantastic and your attention proceed to distribute 
the energy to some one who support/supply energy during executing your task.
You say them thanks by bottom of heart, you realize like you can give the all credit to them in the form of thanks, you realize they are just like messenger of god for you.

Here whatever energy you got during execution of task you take the same one as seeds of energy and you make it tree(in the form of energy) and when the tree(energy) gives
fruit you distribute to them who gives seeds.

***Thanking is the state of distribution of energy***
***Wordful thanking may be drama but the wordless thanking looks in eyes of lives***

A thanking within
------------------------
Withing thanking is one of the most beautiful feeling by spiritual human for them self's. Spiritual human always try very hard in the sense of patience/dedication to achieve
the meditative state and even they get many critical situation their priority never get changed. They supply more and more energy to them self's. They suffer to much when
they unable to accept their transformation during their journey. They feel much pain when their build ed emotion unable to get stable structure.
But when they get sufficient energy to play with waves/energy/emotion they realize much more thankful to that painful state who make them to suffer.

They realize the pain is much more valuable for their life since reason behind that pain are disarrange form of energy only.
They search each and every pain they got in their life and they realize every pain make them to move towards arrangement of waves/energy/emotion builded within.

Before arrangement/structuring of waves, waves need energy of high intensity and when one get high intensity of energy, the same energy never be in the form of
stable structure of waves(this is nothing but high pain) and when one supply more and more energy the same non structured waves get stable structure(this is nothing
but healing)

***Thanking to within energy is nothing but the thanking for everything****

***Dry heart never distribute thanking***
***Dry heart never get pain but they never get healing too***
***Thanking is waves in the form of love***
***Thanking is white/transparent waves get distributed***
