A state of crushing the emotion
===============================
All most all human being get attachment in their life with higher state of energy(higher state of energy means during attachment one realize the flow of energy from some source).
It may be some lady/man/crazy of something/very effective effort towards something/single point movement/ meditation/ yoga/silence/thinning entertainment..so on. it can be anything from that you realize supply of high amount of energy from long time but due to some disturbance it get truncate suddenly and your active state of energy couldn't get arranged and you
feel very high pain that is nothing but state of the crushing of emotion.

Energy is every thing and it run in every state, it depend up on your awareness of the state of energy that keep you light/smooth in every state of life. Energy is in state of god,it is in state of demon/fire/friend/enemy/relativity/principle/..so on ie everything. ie There are unlimited state of energy exits in universal energy system and every action
are proceed by state of energy only nothing else.

So not only the energy is important but also the state of energy is important and crushing of energy is also a state of energy who finding its stability.

crushing the emotion/energy within heart
-------------------------------------------------------
You can activate/build the energy in any ways how do you feel comfortable and smooth but be always in state of alert/aware to its state running within your heart. If you build energy by some external source then it may be more chance during supply of energy to create a state crushing since external source of energy is nothing but dust of energy and with gating energy form external source your expectation increase day by day and when it break the expectation suddenly our heart feel crushing.

Crushing of heart/emotion happen not for a moment but it can run some what long time week/month or may be more, it depends up on your arrangement of non arranged state of energy.

The mechanism behind the crushing of emotion?
---------------------------------------------------------------
When your satisfaction depends on some one/some task/some action/some activity..so on then every one(energy) move more and more towards that satisfaction, ie. arrangement
of your energy depends up on some/some activity, you get habit/smoothness of satisfaction and you flow in that satisfaction, normally human are in state of satisfaction their heart in such a state it just fly, it never care the kite is flying due to symmetric flow of wind.
In the high state of satisfaction your energy are not in normal state it exits in active state and fly like a single wave form but base of this form is supply of energy only that normally we forgot during long time of satisfactions and when the supply of energy get destructed suddenly the energy who are running in satisfaction get disarranged it get distributed in many tiny waves at the state of single wave, since we are unaware about the state of energy so we did't find any another source of energy, we expect the
same source of energy and if the bound of supply energy not gating build/or not gating supply then the same high satisfaction get transform  in to high non satisfactions
and we feel crushing in our heart.
Ex-
Have you been observe when you cook rice by supplying continuous heat and when water get in state of boil and you suddenly destruct the heat how the state of water get changed.
Ex- continuously  giving water to plant and you stop giving water after some days you can see the state of plant.

***Ie overall the disarrangement of energy is nothing but crushing the emotion***
***Creating of energy may be easy but to keep in state of single waves is not that much easy***

Spiritual crushing
-----------------------------------------
Spiritual crushing is also similar path but here the source of energy supply completely depends up on self and due to continuous supply of energy it get lightly arranged.
In case of spirituality the energy/satisfaction always is in very high state so if this energy get disarranged then it also create very high pain that normally come out in
the form of drop of eye.

***Spiritual crushing is much more painful because of the disarrangement of high intensity of energy***
***lightness is nothing but the arranged form of energy and pain in heart is nothing but disarranged form of energy***
