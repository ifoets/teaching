A state of unknown awareness
=============================================
Every experience is unknown just before experience and it is closer to known/known after experience it.
Every one experience/observe every moment in their life. The intensity of observation might be dense/light depends up on their intensity of the power of observation.

Every experience is light it never rigid, Experience never put you in confident/rigid but it put you in light.

Ex-
If you experience the test of water, you never rigid about its test since you know every one test it as restless only.
Every thing your experience it is your experience only what do mean to rigid with it and what do mean to confident with it.

***Experience is nothing but passing from it by open eye***

Experience never make you feel good or stress but it always make you in strange mode and it is adventurous in nature.
In fact experience is not adventurous in nature but due to crossing it first time you feel adventure.

unknown awareness
------------------
Yogi/meditator experience many things that are completely dark/unknown.

A state when they experience my friends in front of me is not really my fried they are some one else but they don't know who they are?
Some time when they talking with some one they realize I am not talking, it is some one else but they don't know who it is?

Some time during mediation they realize I am not meditating it is some one else but they don't know who it is?

Some time during helping some one they realize It is not me who helping but they don't know who it is?

Some time during listening romantic songs they realize I m not listening/healing but they don't know who it is?

you neither worry nor hurry to know how it is, you  know if some one who automatically come in front, it none then  no further meaning.

These type of experience realize due to inner feeling when you haven't put any thing from your side, 
you was just observing during your own activity. Only thing you have been meditating form long time.

***Inner experience change the perception***
***Inner experience increase the density of observation***
