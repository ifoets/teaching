A state of reading itself
===========================
Each and every form of energy just follow the nature ie streaming towards their stability, what happen and what not happen they never take care, it just care about their stability.
They move with light co-bounding, if they realize some other place their stability become more then before breaking the previous bound they complete every formalities and
slightly break the previous bound and make the one new one.

This is the mechanism of energy but when we come to the energy in the form of live specially the life of human. It also follow the same when the energy of life come in their
natural state but before natural state they transform into many state.

A state of reading itself is one of the state of live energy during their transformation towards the natural form of energy.

***Natural form of energy means the energy follow the principle/smoothness of nature/existence***

When mind transform towards observation their is some state it reach when it look its own activities. It try to read itself, in fact the observational state of mind try to
read spread state of mind.

It is the observational state of mind realize that mind is nothing but the distributed form of observation in other words the observation is the pointed/concentrated form of mind.

When observation gating start to read itself(distributed form of observation), it realize a lot of states need to take care when it pass from observation. It realize the
flow of energy. It realize/detect the energy gating distributed from the point form. It realize how the distributed form of energy come towards point form.

It realize it not the mind or observation but the base of these energy is nothing but the energy within.

***State of reading itself is just starting point towards self***
