A state/Significance of patience
======================================
Each and every human being having little or more patience that they use in their day to day life at critical/complex situation/scenarios.
Due to this patience some time they get aggression and some time they feel greatness in themselves/energetic. Some time patience save your life and some time this patience kill your life too. Some time due to patience you make success and some time even you failure due to this patience.

Some time due to patience you keep on travelling non senses path long time but some time due to the same patience keep you travelling on beautiful path long time.

What do you mean patience?
--------------------------------
Patience is a state of emotion/waves/energy that keep hold some states of activity for certain period of time. Due to keep holding this patience both left/right scenario
get birth.

To keep sit/hold on a state is against nature, Nature might look like in some state for certain period of time but Nature never be in non running state.
It always follow streaming in others word Nature always exists in the form of stream forever.

When you keep patience, ie trying to keep a structure of waves in some specific state for certain period of time.
In fact it is not possible to keep structure of waves in static mode, it destroy the nature, ie it not possible.

Then what happens in patience?
-----------------------------------------
Before digging of this query we should know the two phase get created when we start to keep patience.

1. Suppress waves/emotion
This scenario arise due to lack of understanding/lack of energy. None one keep the waves/energy in static state, it is against nature, it will start flow from some different direction.
On the named of patience when we try to suppress our emotion/waves, the waves realize force/non natural affinity in its transformation and due to force the waves break the current state of structure and try to make new structure and try to keep transformation/transmission going on, since we capture some another state of structure of waves the new structures seems to be against our patience then we try to break this structure and try to arrange the waves in old structures and hence fight happens between our artificial mind and new structured wave and finally mind get exhausted. Since not only mind but also any power of human being unable to stop transformation of waves.

***Maximum human can observe/look or make new structures of waves for their use but never stop their transformation***
***Suppress of emotion/waves on named of patience keep our life in poor state***

2. Be with emotion/waves structures
In this state we neither hurry to change the emotions/waves structures not suppress the emotions/keep waves structure as it is, 
ie we Neither forcing the emotion/current waves structures to make new structure nor we strict with old waves structure.
We move with waves structures transformation as much possible.
At this state we understand how much time will take some activity to complete that will take obviously and so we are with current state of activities.

***If some one seems to be in patience and light together then they are in 2nd form of patience***

In patience either we suppress the emotions or be with it, Be with it make you feel great but suppress make you feel exhausted
***1. State look like waiting state and 2. state look like wait and look/watch***
***Patience that make you more and more light***
