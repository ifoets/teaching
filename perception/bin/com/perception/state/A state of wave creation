========================================
In this universe only waves/energy are in transmission /structuring/flow/change of states/decreeing intensity /increasing intensity /interacting /separation 
/collision..so on.and object are the representative of above action/transformation of waves/energy.
All the action/function are in streaming and reason behind streaming of object/energy is the movement of waves. The waves use mass for applying the force/friction/creation.

Ie means it is the waves/energy who responsible for each and every things in this universe not any others powers like me/you/god. It is different things you/me use the waves
or waves use you for some transformation/action. But overall the waves/energy are the center of any activities.

Ex-
A fish/group of fish swim inside water and creating some waves inside water, this is the water where waves get created, fishes are just changing their position and direction
of swim, ie means fishes just supply some energy/swimming to change the structure of water, it means waves inside water is already exists in the form of non active states of waves and fishes supply energy/swimming to water so water get some waves(active state).
Similar way our mind/senses not creating the waves but it activating the non active state of energy into activate state and with the supply of more energy it take a form of waves.

The mechanism behind creating the waves?
----------------------------------------------------------
It is already discussed waves can't be created since it is just a form of energy but it seems to be created since a non active state of energy come in active state due to supply
of energy and it get some structure of waves (just transformation)i and t is get used for some activities.

Ex-
Let us consider a pond is full of transparent water and there is no any wind flow on the surface of water and a Object(A) sitting on the shore of pond.

If A is a observer, it just observe the bottom/top of water/water/the lives inside water/..ie A is just for observation, it not interface the water.

If A is mind/senses, it also try to observe the water/bottom of water/the lives inside water.. but due to lack of energy within A the things not get detected by the A. or the attention of A .get slip to observe.
In other words A unable to interact the activities(waves) of water/bottom of water/the lives inside water So where A will get engaged. A find the similar frequency energy to engage itself.

Then A pick a stone and throw in water(some energy get supplied by A in the form of throwing stone).
When stone get collide with water it makes instance of space and for stability of water in pond (water around space get created) suddenly try to fill the space and hence move speedily towards the center of space and when it fill the space the waters who are responsible to fill the space get collide
wit each others in opposite of direction (circular) and hence finally due to this collision a waves get created in opposite to direction of collision.

This is nothing but creating the waves. In fact waves already exists on the surface of water A just supply energy by using some interface(stone) and make a space on the surface
of water(thats all) next of the task done by water automatically(creation/activation) of waves/transmission of waves.

Similar ways your mind/senses task is to just make the hindrance in this universe of waves and rest of things automatically get done by waves and you behind waves
get happiness or frustration that depends up on your state of mind/senses.

***Waters get collision towards center and waves get created towards away form center..ie opposite in direction***
***Nothing is static mind/senses/intellect/observation since streaming is only the state of nature exists***
***If you are not in the state of observation then you automatically make hindrances to universe of the waves, how much drama you can do/show on this world never save you from hindrance***
***Hindrance is the state of mind/senses***
