A state of the architecture of observation
==========================================
Every state of energy/waves not simply form but there are many layers of the architecture of waves are arranged/designed within them. Whatever the state of energy/waves we 
realize that are the point of energy/waves but the base of that point of energy/waves are hidden in their internal arrangement/architecture of waves.

Every state in front of you are face of point energy but there are many roots and soot giving support to that face point of energy. Internal structure of energy is always valuable / readable /observable since the external/face of energy representation is directly depends the internal roots and soot. 

Ex-
If you think/feel/act/process something that is the face point of energy and whatever the internal layers of arrangement/architecture of energy/waves within you(at the sate
of think/feel/act/process) due to which the action going to proceed is nothing but the roots/soot of face point of energy. Without concrete roots/soot of energy none of the 
face point energy affect the life.
You may observe there are many things/ situation/ scenario/ problems come in front of your life but not all the stuff get in process because they don't create the internal root ans soot
of waves/energy.
- You look many humans in poor state of suffering but you supply energy to some one not to all, If you observe why you supply energy to some one only why not to all then you
can get the root reason behind that and if you dig the root reason more and more then you will get the some linking/understanding about your process towards some one.

-Before any waves/emotion/energy emerge on your surface of mind/surface of heart they get supported by many tiny layers of waves and the layers architecture of arrangement of tiny waves
is nothing but the internal architecture of waves.
 
***None of the waves/energy simply flow but they get supported by their internal layers of tiny waves architecture***

Similar way not only the mind but also the feeling /observation /realization/understanding/streaming of energy/tends to zero..so on..not simply get constructed. There are many
many chains of layers of the waves/energy internally support for construction of some state.

-If you tens then it not happen in single moment, it seems to be/get detected in single moment but before it seems to be tens it take lot of process to build their internal
structure of waves and they construct the chaining of their layers and finally when the face point of waves hit your senses /mind/observation/realization/understanding..so on that time you understand/realize you are in tense/you are lack of energy/you are in under stress.

Similar ways the observation state of energy within you not simply get constructed in single day/week/year but before it get constructed it take much more transformation/much more layers of 
energy/much more chaining of layers/much more tiny waves arrangement/much more supply of energy/much more layers of architecture of waves..so on, but when it get constructed
then you realize to detect/observe the flow of waves/emerging of waves/construction of waves/the effect of waves/stats of waves/streaming of waves/layers structure of waves.so on

Ex-
How our mind get constructed it takes years and years, it get layers by layers structure of its existence,it get solidity day by day, it get confidence about its existence
when there are much more imagination /knowledge /feeling/thinking/poor understanding/poor realization/tight bounding/tight security/tight survival..so on support to construct
their internal structure of waves(chain by chain and layers by layers) and when the internal structure get constructed then mind(face point of energy) get in state of fly.

Observational state of energy is nothing but the transformed state of mind energy only, when you supply more and more energy year by years then after a decade you feel the state
of observation. 

What happen in decade when you had been continuously supplied the energy to within?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In that intermediate period of time every roots and soot of mind energy(all internal structure/layers of waves/chaining of waves) getting energy and getting reconstruct the internal layers of architectures and when all the internal layers /chaining/tiny waves get converted into another structure of high intensity then you realize the state of observation.
You realize the functionality of mind/you look the activities of waves gating construct within you, the state of waves gating inter within..so on

Ex-
When you put the seed of mango in fertile soil and give every day water  and after 5/10 year you get the mangoes. Whatever the mango you get is not simply get in your hand but before that there are much more process/the flow of energy/the state get changed.

***Fruit is the face point of tree and internal arrangement of energy within tree is support the face point only***
***Observation is the intermediate state of mind energy towards the state of the streaming of energy***
