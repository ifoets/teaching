****Isolation state of co-existence
========================================
In day to day life one can observe the stuff getting change in shape/size/structure/color/weight/nature/behavior/..so on.
In fact the stuff is always exists in streaming/changing/ transformation state but due to lack of observation they realize when our energy system get detect the difference in their previous and current state. Every stuff in this universe exits in transformation state in any ways since this is nature of
all stuff.

Why every stuff in this universe exists in dynamic state?
---------------------------------------------------------
What happen when a object exists in static state forever, it makes collapse the complete universe, each and every object transform from one state to another state, there must be a time
come when all dynamic object transform into static state and hence universe get collapse. 

Every object/energy/stuff have some property/capability and based on that they act. Similar ways it is the property/nature of every object/energy/stuff to exits in streaming state.
You can observe how a seed become tree/wood/ashes..so one. How to soil become stone, stone become sands and sands become soil again. Cyclic is not the nature but it come on
path of transformation nature of object/energy.

Every object in this universe get made by mass and energy. Mass and energy is the root/core of the instant existence of any stuff, since energy exists in streaming state and
every object not only contain the mass but also the energy within. since energy exits in stream within object then object automatically exits in streaming.

***Weight in mass due to mass and capacity within that object due to state of energy within***
Ex- Same weight of soil/gold/diamond/platinum/life/stone..etc have different capacity/property due to their internal arrangement of the state of energy within only.

***It is the state of energy within any stuff who is responsible for everything belonging to that object***

co-existence
----------------
Co-existence is the center/core/root of every existence. Without co-existence the existence of any object/energy is beyond/out of observation/realization/understanding/feeling and even imagination too.

Object/energy exists in space, without space none can imagine even where exists/keep the object/energy. As observation the energy/object exits in streaming and any thing require time/moment/laps for streaming, without time streaming/transformation/transmission of any activities can't be observe/imagine.

Without time,(space,energy,mass) unable to digest. Without space, (energy/mass) unable to digest, Without energy, mass unable to digest. The co-existence is the creator of every
object/live. What every get created by co-existence hence they follow the co-existence and that's why they require time, space, energy and mass.

***Co-existence is the seeds of every creation.***
***None of stuff get exits without co-existence***
***Together (Time, Space, Energy and Mass) is nothing but co-existence*** 

Isolation state of co-existence
-------------------------------
Mass transform into mass only, it may behaves like energy but it never transform into energy, Energy can be transform into another energy(higher/lower) state but never transform into
mass. Time can be transform into time only, it never transform into mass/energy/space. Similar ways space can be transform into another space(smaller/bigger) but it never transform
into mass/energy/time.

When Object get transform in another object then mass transform into mass only and energy within that mass get transform into energy they never get exchange between each other.

Co-existence require each other together for existence of any stuff/life but-but they never get any exchange into one another. The 4 pillar of existence have their own frequency / intensity /nature and they never intersect each other.

The cores of co-existence exits are in isolation state with each other forever but they all exists in single phase for every existence.

***There is no any bounding between co-existence for exchange into each other and without bounding between them none of live/object exits***
***The state of Time, Space, Energy and Mass exits in isolation with each other***
***Time, Space, Energy, Mass change their states into respective by following the isolation not between each others***
