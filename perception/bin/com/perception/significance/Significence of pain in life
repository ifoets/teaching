Significance of pain in life
======================================
Every human being getting pain in their life time to time and every one try a lot to overcome from this state.
When pain come in our life, Our central purpose is to overcome from this at any cost as quick as possible. If we get pain in consistence , 
we get frustrated, in this scenario
we compare to others life and getting more frustration. After this we realize our life is in hell.
We search here and there how to come out from this state of mind and even after certain time we get out of this state too.

But have you been observe? The similar process run time to time in our entire life and even we get some experience at every time but overall 
previous experiences not stop us for further frustration.
Here your previous experiences work but their intensity to stop for further frustration is negligible specially for new scenarios.

Why? Why our previous experiences get paused? or their intensity to wok is very less.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before know above query first of all we should know/understand, what is pain? and why we feel stress/heart during pain?
Or How pain is invented in us? or how we vanish its effect..so on.

If we have insufficient energy in us, then our senses start looking hear and there for energy, if they get some thing/object from there they 
can absorb some energy, they try to absorb from object. If they get failure then our senses get obstruct form that objects.
but If our senses get success to absorb a little energy our heart get good feeling and demanding more energy to increase the same feeling, 
again our scenes try to absorb more energy from same objects but if object is unable to provide the more energy.

ie. a request of more energy goes from good feeling of heart to senses and from senses to particular object but response from object to senses and 
finally form senses to heart is null.

At the state when heart get energy first time and feeling good the molecules in heart get activated for stabilization and expecting more energy form senses 
for more stabilization
since next time the molecules in our heart not get energy from our senses, they start to scramble(‡§õ‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ-‡§ù‡§™‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ) energy in between themselves and due to scramble of energy
from each others the hole system of molecules get in zig zag motion ie as a group of molecule(inside heart) get disestablish and due to non stability of group of molecules
(inside heart) having some more energy(that get in first request) we feel pain in our heart.
This is nothing but the pain.
When this similar non stability happen in brain it is nothing but the stress.

***Pain is nothing but due to the dis arrangement from of energy in a group in our heart***
***The mechanism behind pain and stress is same..due to distribution/dis arrangement of energy***

If our understanding is even little high then we try to make these unstable group of molecule in particular structure/ fashion so they can 
create a stable wave form of same energy just we have to supply very less amount of external energy to a group of molecules that we can supply 
from our little understanding too.

At every state of life the energy get created from our understanding is sufficient to change the unstable state of feeling(pain) to stable state.
Every human using the above process/concept/mechanism only to obstruct their pain but very rare human being have understanding of the internal mechanism 
of the same process.

If we have understanding of this process we can enhance it or refine it at each and every moment of time the same.
In fact who have this understanding they never get pain in their life easily because they use the same mechanism every times.

***Due to our poor understanding only previous experiences not work and every time we get tens/pain***

Significance of pain in life
--------------------------------
***Neither things are painful nor things are favorable..this is your experience/non experience that make it anythings***

If we understand the central mechanism of pain then we never worry about pain even is in very high state, we can use/transform pain in very useful purpose, ie when you 
make the disarranged energy in arrange form the same energy who gives pain the same one will give you heal.
ie just you have to transform form disarrange to arranged form next state the arranged energy it self create certain wave and that wave make you heal.

How much you suffer in you life at certain time that much energy you have in disarranged form but because of only poor understanding we don't transfer it.

***Pain is most beautiful energy but it is in the form of dark, if you have sufficient understanding then you can transform it form dark to light***

Why the person who suffer lot in their life, When come on spiritual path they move rapidly?
Since they have much dark energy they have to just make it in the form of wave/light by meditation.

***50% of energy we need to for activation(ie initially disarrange form..ie dark) and 50% need for transformation from dark to light*** 

Normal human being very rarely come on spiritual path since their hole arrangement/management of their life is that how to  keep away form pain/tense 
and steel the happiness also together.
Because of micro management of life they never get very high pain/stress since they are very dynamic with pain/stress/happiness.
That's why the small amount of dark energy even get created they never realize for their transformation.

***If you have to know something then you have not only sit/love with that but also keep ur patience high/long too***

***Your security keep you secure at the same time the same security stop you to fly in the sky having storm***
