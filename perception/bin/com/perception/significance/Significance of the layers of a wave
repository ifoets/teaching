Significance of the layers of a wave
====================================
Each and every waves having some structured form of energy and it affect the others wave when it get in touch. This is internal structure of waves who makes its intensity
high or low, and due to its intensity that affect the action.
Each and every waves not simply get structure/construction but there is special purpose for what it get constructed.

Ex-
You may observe the flame of rod cutter that is also a state of fire only but it's structured in such a ways it cant cut the rod.
You may also observe the flame of Lamp their size is almost near about the size of rod cutter but can it cat rod? No

Every waves have many layers in their structure and it affect others waves layer by layer. Each waves having maximum intensity at middle and minimum intensity at corner side.

Why wave have max intensity at middle and min at corner?
-------------------------------------------------------
At the middle of waves stream of energy are in maximum matching state(higher stability) and at the corner the wave the stream of energy are in lower matching state(lower stability).
Ex-
-You may observe when a group of bird make waves during their fly the birds at corner many times goes little away form a group but the birds at middle of waves never get
away from group.
The intensity at middle layers of waves only providing support to the corner layer of waves.
- You can observe when you make close your finger towards a lamp, the heat gating by your finger is increase as you move towards lamp. ie at corner of flame gives lesser heat
than at middle since at corner layer the intensity of fire is lesser than at middle layer.
-You can observe the waves in sea, the top(upper part) of wave having high intensity and this part get chance to transform into foam.

***Every layers of a wave/wave structure have different intensity, it is max at middle and it is min at corner***

Interaction with layers of waves?
------------------------------------------
Many of us read book/listen audio/look video/look dance/look any special arrangement of waves but different people get different meaning/enjoyment/understanding/realization
form same stuff.

Why different human get different understanding by same stuff?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we not simply interact the waves but it depends up on our intensity/our caliber on the basis of that we(energy within) interact the layers of waves.

Ex-
A master speak with some intensity in a group of people, The waves in their statement have many layers and these layers have different intensity.
The intensity in which our life float/stream, our life get interaction of similar intensity layers and hence we different people get different meaning of same stuff.

A master had spoken 1000-10000 year ago and the waves in their statement is floating now a days also but what you will get/understand/realize from their waves/statement depends up on your intensity.

***A Weak intensity wave interact with corner layers and high intensity waves interact with middle layers of floating waves***
***A Waves get structured by stream of its layers structures***
