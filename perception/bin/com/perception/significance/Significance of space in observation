Significance of space in Observation
==========================================
Time, space and in being are coexistence. If you separate these you will either find one is meaningless than others.
But the separation of coexistence is meaningless for creation at the same it is meaningful for observation.
Similar way if you break the time till your observation can break it, it is very useful for observation.
If you increase/decrease/break the space, it is useful for observation.

None of streaming is waiting for observation ie.. means every things is in being/streaming for ever so if you want
to observe you have to tune/break the stuff by your observation.

Ex-
If you want to test your development/creation, you have to provide different type of input to check, it should be work
in different time and situation.

If you are crazy for some particular type of food, just wait and observe the craziness in you with time, you realize how time is spending the craziness decrease
and how you much satisfaction you expect that much satisfaction you never get.

If have habit of some toxic element, when you feel to take, just wait and observe, you realize the intensity to take the toxic element decrease.

If are in pain ie fighting with yourself, just wait and observe what I am doing, you realize your frustration decrease.

If you look some object is beautiful on the road, just go to close 2-4 feet just for observation, you will realize the pulling/pushing intensity decrease.

If you have fear from you boss, just go close to him, just observe the intensity of fear decrease in you.

Why frequency of worry or hurry decrease when you try to observe?
Since your attention change the direction of flow of energy from worry/hurry to observation.
This is attention only who increase the intensity of anything since your flow of energy centralized with your attention at particular place.

Why intensity of fluctuation decrease when you close to some situation for observation?
When you go close to something for observation, you state of brain/attention move in next zone where neither you fight nor you support the things and the intensity of your emotion always increase/decrease with fight/support
 
***If you want to know something, you have to make friendship with them and just observe your intensity before and after*** 
***Be light for observation, neither flow nor stop with object***

Space between you and object always change your perception very slightly.
You cant dig each and every object but your observation can dig where you want to penetrate.

***Digging of single object at extreme level can tell the story of each and every object***
