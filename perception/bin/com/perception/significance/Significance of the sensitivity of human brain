Significance of the sensitivity of human brain
==============================================
The game behind each and every action is due to waves/streaming of energy inside every action in a specific fashion.
Every parts/organs of lives have their own importance but the brain take lead for surviving the lives.

The sensitivity nature of brain is due to the arrangement/design of waves inside brain having a special complexity.

Why bran is more sensitivity?
----------------------------
It is not only the arrangement/design of waves inside them but also the intensity of waves take play a role here. Due to a special design/arrangement and intensity of waves in brain
makes it very dynamic in its activity. Due to very dynamic nature of its activity brain seems to be sensitive.

Whenever some new object/energy/waves/imigination come in picture in front of brain, it have caliber to create new wave to detect it and even it fit the newly added waves code
for further recognition/use/test.

Human brain is much more sensitive than other existence of lives. Due to its highly sensitive in nature it detect the object/energy in different manor than others lives.
Due to its highly sensitivity it have caliber to arrange/disarrange the structure of waves due to which it running rapidly.

Due to its caliber/capability of arrangement/disarrangement of its own structures of waves it perceive in different manor than other lives.
This is the center, this is the base of every event happen in humans lives.

Due to the power of sensitivity it create its own world and manage the newly created world from some center that is nothing but mind.

***The existence of mind is nothing but the ego***
***Mind is nothing but a the collection of tests***

Mind has its own journey, it try to keep its existence since it seems to be itself is the life/survival of life. It left behind its creation, it start take a different shape/structure for further action of life.

It is very rare chance mind detect itself in lack of its arrangement/design and even when it detect the lack of its stability it again and again try to arrange/stabilize
by its own management. Due to its own management it create more and more complexity for itself.

At some of point of its journey when mind detect its complexity/suffering/its creation the mind create a feeling in heart and decide something else like
it have lack of energy due to which it stay in stretch state.

Mind try to find the energy form many resources to come out from stretch sate. But here mind get a little amount of energy from external source and hence its existence move here and there for energy.
When mind get a little realization there is a center within us only where sufficient amount of energy available to come out form stretched state.

Then the same mind finding how to use this energy for its own purpose during the searching state when its get some activity like yoga/meditation/silence or something else
who provide energy form source within it.

When mind use body/itself for sufficient energy and when it get sufficient energy and if it try to travel on same pattern then
After certain period of time the same mind behaves something different since it getting transformed in to observation.

***Observation is nothing but the transformed formed of mind who capable to detect the light waves***

Now control goes to observation and it take long time to observe different things around itself.

When observation realize it need to supply more and more energy to itself for smoothness of life the same observation transformed into realization, understanding, awareness
and finally it understand the streaming of energy anywhere/every where.

***Continuous supply of energy can transform mind to understanding of the steaming of energy***
