===============================================
Lightness is the nature for observation and imagination is the nature of mind.
None can force the nature/streaming of anything after certain period of time.
The  nature of observation is to just observe, neither it support nor it oppose the nature.

Meditative state is the active state of mind where mind unable to response ie.. zero state of mind.
If some one is in meditative state they neither in state of think nor in state of breathing.

***Sleeping is the unconscious state of meditation and meditation is the conscious state of sleep***
