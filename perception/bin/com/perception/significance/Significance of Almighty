Significance of Almighty
========================================
The general assumption of almighty is that, there is a power who have all the authority to do any thing in universe, who is creator, runner and destroyer of the every elements/lives/wave/particles/objects..so on of in this universe.
In single word you can say streaming of energy is the center of transformation but this transformation is not under wishes of any almighty, its happen its own. The center of transformation is due the exchange of energy between the particles/waves/objects/emotions/thoughts/lives..so on.

         ***Almighty doesn't exits within single power***
         ***Almighty as single power can't be experience because of its nonexistence***

The concept of almighty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every instance of energy/form of energy/objects/waves/particles/thoughts/emotions/lives..so on is almighty in itself.
If a wave collide with some particles and provide some energy the particles get transform into another particles whose form ,nature and state gets change. 
We can say this is the creation of new particles and death of old particles.In fact the state of particles gets change.

***Neither any creation nor any destruction but just the transformation***

Ex-
