Significance of Religion
============================================
The humans follow many of given/created pattern in their life and one of them is Religion. This is nothing but a pattern who might simplify your life a very little/more or might make you more critical/rigid it totally depends up on your understanding of it.

Not only the pattern of Religion but also any pattern behaviors in two phases since mechanism behind to move on that pattern is to take a benefit/full fill the greed.
If any thing that gives you benefit then the same thing make you attach too or the same things make a circumference for your life that not allow to fly beyond that circumference.

There of three types of human in origin of Religion or types of understanding the Religion.

1. The human who follow some Religion since their family/culture have been following it. They don't know anything about it before they start follow but after they move on the path after certain period of time they get many activity like reading religious books/worshiping/praying or certain guideline to move on that pattern. Due to religious activities they get 
injected many things in their mind who either force little or pull tittle/may spark to move on that path. Since many of them move around the path having same purpose so it make a wave and since they don't have understanding about the waves created by followers they just follow it blindly. The greed/fear or feeling better than non religious human keep sustain them on the path.

Ex-Priest,Mullah,Fathers..or follower of these humans

2. Who have been following the 1 scenario since long time and after analysis on surface of mind->intellect->observation..so on they get something like it not affect the life
much, ie their greed not fulfill by Religion or they don't have fear of god on their surface of mind->intellect->observation then they quit and move on non religious path like they concentrate on their job/business/family/passion..so on.

Ex-
Business man,Politician,writer, Actors..so on

3. Who before entering into the scenario 1 & 2 they realize/get wave from inside in their life and they make his own path separately in his believe system. They follow
a dynamic pattern that they getting form inside time to time.

Ex- Meditator,Silence people, Yogi, Saint..so on

Is Really Religion have some significance in human life?
-------------------------------------------------------
It has explained the different meaning of religion(1. made pattern,2.non pattern and 3.new pattern).
The answer of above query is different for different strength humans.

1. Yes(for middle strength/energy)
If some have sufficient energy to take spark from religion(1) and try to transform into (3) then it is very significance for them.

2. NO(for week people/less energy)
The same religion behaves differently for week human, it create color/paint in his mind that stop further analysis into deep of religion they just move like dead body on the path of religion. In fact they take religion differently due to their poor understanding and always greed form religion and to see the greed nature by cleaver Priest,Mullah,Father..
They exploit(‡§∂‡•ã‡§∑‡§£) the humans, they keep them into fear/greed by using the name of god and due to poor understanding the humans have no any clue to go into deeper behind the religion.

3. Not at all(Having inner feeling/even a little energy from inside)
They don't look towards religion since they have to make own religion for their life and they move some time consistently and some time zig zag way since their path
is completely new. They suffer lot and they feel adventurous a lot time to time.

Ex- The wind/storm have different effect on fire, If fires are poor it evict/extinguish them, If fire having high strength then the same wind/storm heal/help them and if fire is even small but it is inside cave where wind/storm not reach then the same wind/storm have no effect on fire.

***Not only the amount of energy but also the intensity inside the energy decide the effect***
