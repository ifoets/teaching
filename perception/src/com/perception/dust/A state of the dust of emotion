A state of the dust of emotions
===========================
Each and every lives have emotions at every state of life, Due to this emotion one get the feeling of happiness/pain/satisfaction/energetic/tens/frustration/sadness/confidence/knowledgeable / week/strong/..so on. Emotions is the face point of waves and there are lot of hidden mechanism/architecture behind building of this emotions. You realize the
emotion at the time when it affect your life in any of direction. But this emotion not simply get build when you realize/feel it, it get lot of process during its building
and when it affect you life that time the waves of emotions are in their extreme state of streaming.

Ex-
When you senses/mind get active about some state of object, if object look useful for you ie. your senses/mind get active towards the energy hidden in that object, at this
point the waves in your senses/mind get created and it transform to heart in the seeds of feeling, this seeds of feeling may or may not get detected by your observation.
When your mind/senses gating active to pull/steal the energy hidden in that object ie now mind/senses are in process of gating energy it find the path for same.
When sends/mind get some path then it act to move on that path, if it fail then it again try to find some another path and it pass to reach to energy of that object then
it try to interact the energy of that object..so on
In the process of steal/pull the energy from above object your emotion is not simply sitting but getting build layer by layer and finally you get a time when your emotion
get in its extreme state and make you feel.

This emotion is instantly/temporary since it depends up on external source of energy and external source of energy never is in you control of action completely. 

***The emotion get constructed by your senses/mind never is nothing but the dust of emotion***
***Dust of emotion is stumbling block for your journey within***

This dust of emotion gating constructed by senses/mind and it helps to make powerful/week to your senses/mind and mind is your external existence, it will make you engage in external life.

When you not believe in your imagination/thought then your control of believe system get transform into feeling and it seems to be your feeling is right for your life at least,
since this feeling drive your life,you have to follow your emotion but the dust of emotion drive the external state of life it not affect the inner intelligence system.

***The dust of emotion is byproduct of emotions and it never be productive for journey within***

Normally humans always engage in their dust of emotions since this dust of emotions seems to be provide them maximum source of stability/satisfaction. Dust of emotion means the emotions always is in state of distribution and due to distributed state/nature of the dust of emotion some time it realize you happy and next time the same emotion
realize you sad. Since the emotions are in the form of dust it need very high supply of energy to centralize/arrange in single wave and it never get from to senses/mind.

***senses/mind have limitation for creation of emotion***

The dust of emotion get created by senses/mind it always get interacted by the same mind for any activities and you know the functionality of mind how it work. It(mind) also 
work like dust of thinking.

***Dust of emotion never/very rarely give a valuable changes in your life***
***Dust of emotion always play with your mind and mind also play with dust of emotion***
***Dust of emotion and mind interchange the some state of energy for their existence***

Inner state of emotion
------------------------------------------------------
Inner state of emotion never will be temporary and ever get created by activities of sense/mind, it make you suffer or delight for long time and it will always take long time to arrange/disarrange. When you have been continuously supplying energy to within by practicing meditation/yoga/silence..so on, a time come in front of you when you feel something from inside that you never imagine in your entire life.
You never get any idea of this emotion. It takes time to aware of this emotion.
At inner state of emotion your senses/mind seems to be in state of paralysis since the base of its construction is not the senses/mind but the high intensity state of energy.
So it get awareness by observation not by mind/senses.

Here you have to turn your sense/mind/perception/awareness otherwise this emotion automatically make your mind get turned towards it.
What you will do when you feel very strongly something from long time your mind can't touch this emotion since its state of intensity is very high than the state of energy having mind.

***Inner emotion is productive state of emotion, it makes smooth the journey within***
***Inner state of emotion is highly painful if it get disarranged state of waves***
***Inner state of emotion keep you in healing when its tiny waves get some stable architecture of single wave***
***Inner state of emotion open the inner door it turn your life towards within***

Dust of emotion is not only distributed but also the waves/energy inside that emotion is in very poor state/very low intensity where as the inner state of emotion not only
centralize/single wave(after awareness) but also it is with very high intensity of waves/energy.

***Unawareness of inner emotion might send your life in very dangerous state, every one should sensitive about its awareness before it get created***
***Your entire life awareness get washed when inner state of emotion get created but your sensitivity makes you flexible with it***
