A state of the dust of observation
=========================================
Not only the lives of humans but also every lives have power of observation, they use this power in their day to day life for smooth movement. If you observe the animals/birds
or other creature then you can realize their power of observation is like the human's observation. They have different types of power of observation and these are centralize in them.
Whatever the power of observation are in the lives of animal/birds that are in smooth state since they don't have powerful mind to break it in the form of dust.

Ex-
If dogs have the power of observation to detect the some special states of waves they detect it in their entire life. Birds have power of observation based on that they get
the direction of their fly then this observation are smooth in their entire life just like the basic fundamentals in their lives.

Human have also some basic power of observation like others lives but due their powerful senses/mind the same observation not stay smooth in their entire life, it either get 
enhanced/diminished based on their energy supply/distribution to/from within.

***Whatever one observe that is just the sate of observation, neither it is wrong nor it is right, it is just a wave who detect some state of energy***

A state of the dust of observation
-----------------------------------------
When you observe something you realize the flow of energy since it get detected by observation. If you realize this just a state of observation, it is just the sate of energy
within, if you realize it is neither to be carry, if you realize it is just a fun to look the flow state of waves. Then same observation look like just a state.

***Observation is highly flexible, it never get rigidity with it state of observation***

But when your observation get tight/rigidity, when the observation make tight bounding, when your observation realize you it is right/wrong for every one then the same
observation become dust of observation.
When the state of observation distribute the energy in the form of object, before distribution of energy the state of observation it self get distributed and hence it become the 
dust of observation.

***Dust of observation is nothing but the one rigid/distributed state/poor intensity state of observation***

The mechanism behind the dust of observation
--------------------------------------------------------------
When you observe something, it is in the form of single waves only and it work on the state of observe. It is nigher any right or wrong what you get observe.Till this state
whatever you observe are in state of light. But when you rigid/tight/stick with this observation ie you realize some one make it dust so you try to save whatever you get observed
and you put energy to save your observation. Whatever energy you put to save the observation that energy get reduced in your power of observation only at that state and due to lack of energy in your power of observation the same observation get distributed(the internal structure of the waves of observation get lack of energy to keep the sate of observation in stable state) and hence the same observation become the dust of observation.

The observation you try to carry out ie putting some energy to carry out is nothing but the dust of observation. When you stick/tight/rigid with you observation this observation
is nothing but the dust of observation.

***dust of observation doesn't makes valuable changes in your life***

You may realize not me/you but every one have some power of observation that is nothing but dust of observation. The dust of observation always engages with poor state of energy
it can't inject within life. It need lot of energy supply to become a single waves of observation.

***Not only the state of observation always keep the stuff in light state but also it keep its state in light***
