Significance of reverse transformation/A state of reverse transformation
===========================================
If we have been doing some activity/practice/work done continuously from long time then due to this activity you life change very little each and every day that you cannot detect
the changes but after many year you can observe the changes when you relate the current state form with your old state of form.
But when you want to just feel/observe/realize/understand the things like you had feel/observe/understand when you start these activities.

What should you do? is there any option?
Yes there is option available but you have to scarify a lot or play with your stored energy/object.

If you are really ready then only you can come in previous state of mind and you can observe/feel/understand as you was feeling with start of activity.
Your experience will be with you but you need to release the energy.

***If you are ready to play with your life then only these types of experiment come in our observation***

Ex-
just for observation:-
If you have sufficient energy then you are capable to melt your heart by crying with your emotion, due to continuous cry not only your energy but also your ego/attitude/rigidness get released together up to certain level and if you are ready to observe ,then you can observe you feel like child, even your activity will become like child, you may feel innocent,
At this state you mind is not active as it was with energy.
You can observe lightness in you.

Ex-just for observation
If you have been  doing business/job and you have gather/collect some what good amount in last decade, then you left job/stop business till your money become zero
and try to realize how do you feel, since you have experience with you so it is some what difficult to feel like jobless/business less as you was feeling before stat of business/ job but you can observe it is some what to similar to that.

Ex-just for observation 
If you practice meditation/yoga/silence from long time continuously and your feeling/ observation/ realization/ understanding are in good condition, then for observation just you leave these activity at least 1/2 month completely and then you try to observe your energy level/feeling/observation/realization,understanding so on...Since at this state you observation power also get decreased but even you can observe lack of energy/ feeling/ observation/understanding, 
-You can observe the problem that look like game again become problem,
-You can realize you are in little exhausted state but things are under control of you, since you are doing these activity just for observation.
-You may observe your bound again seeming to be tight,
-You can observe again the little scenario try to initialize pressure,
-You may observe the old activity trying to inject in you.
-You can observe the songs kept you in healing state the same songs just giving little feeling.
-You can observe as you had enjoyed every things new none of thins make you to enjoy or give very little enjoyment.
-You may observe laziness try to attack or it attack
_You may observe You had used to fly in dancing in alone now your energy/feeling/head not supporting to do dance even.

If you leave the things/activities/object/energy completely that you had been doing from long time, whatever energy you have collected/gathered that will be used by your activity and since you do not supply energy after certain period of time you will back to you old position/state this is nothing but the reverse state of transformation.

***Reverse state of transformation should be in under control otherwise these Experiment may make you slip in different direction of transformation***
***In this experiment we loose every things except our experience and that also seems to be in lose state but with us only***
***Reverse transformation happen automatically just you have to stop and after certain period time you observe***
