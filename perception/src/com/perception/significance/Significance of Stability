Significance of Stability
========================================
Stability is the nature of streaming of energy. It is nature of not only the lives but also the each and every 
atoms/molecules/particles/waves/energy/objects/systems..so on.

What do you mean by stability?
--------------------------------------------------
Before going to above query first of all we should understand about stability and non stability together.

***Neither anything is stable nor it unstable for forever***
Stability and non stability is the state of energy/object and neither of the state of energy/object is forever since it is against the existence.

Non stability
---------------
It is a state of energy/object in which their internal molecules are not form any arrangement/bound in given atmosphere so as a group of atoms/molecule/sub elements/elements..so on
active separately ie and they try to make bound between them and due to affinity towards stability the internal element move faster and faster for their stability as a group.

***Non stability is nothing but very rapid transformation state of object/energy***

Stability
----------------
Similar way stability is nothing but the very slow transformation between their internal states 
 of atoms/molecule/sub elements/elements.
ie the sate maintain long time is known as stable state but it never be forever.

***Neither any object is stay in maximum stable state nor any object is stay in minimum stable sate since it is against the existence/streaming ya but some states of object
will be in their minimum stable sate during its transformation and some state will be in the maximum stable state***

Why stability is the nature of every things?
-------------------------------------------------------
When one object reach to their highest stable state ie.. form here it can't go in more stable state then the arrangement of waves who keep the object in their maximum stable sate get changed in some different form and these activity happen with each and every elements of  nature and that make nature colorful and this is the existence of nature.

***Maximum stable state during transformation is nothing but the one threshold form where nature turn their state in different from and due to this only nature look colorful***

Ex-
When you are in tense state, you feel to move towards peaceful state, here peaceful state is nothing but maximum stable state of tens and tense is minimum stable state of peaceful.
When you reach to peaceful state any you supply more energy it break the threshold and move in to new form known as observation..so on.

What happen when one stuff reach it stable state?
***It is threshold state of particular from from here the internal wave structure start changing into different fashion***
