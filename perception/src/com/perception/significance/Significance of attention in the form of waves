Significance of attention in the form of waves
==============================================
Whatever our senses/mind detect that are at very last(some intermediate..since nigher any last state nor any first state) state of activities.

Any activities what we look in front of us that cross from many more phases/sates and during there process a time come when their states are in co state
 of our senses/mind/observation from where our senses/mind detect them.

Ex-
If you open face book and login your profile, When you enter your user name and password and when you click login, your profile page come in front of you.
If you are a software developer you can observe before login to your profile, your login click waves in the form of bit/byte carry your user name and password 
and it transmit from 1000 of modules,million of class, many methods, many logics, many testing, many securities, many barriers..so on.

We unaware millions of developers worked for that, we unaware million of situations faced by millions of team working for Facebook, we unaware how many revolution 
occur in this sites.

Similar way when we click on some file  in our commuter it cross million of process before open in front of us but our mind are capable to detect the file opening.
In above process million of mechanism working internally and these million of mechanism is nothing when we compare it's process with natural process since natural
process is always in state of processing/streaming and we detect anything in intermediate based on our intensity of detection.

What do you mean attention?
--------------------------------------
When you login your computer, when you come on your desktop you look desktop but millions of process/threads running internally simultaneously.
When you open browser your sufficient computer waves flow in certain direction to open browser. When you type some website on your browse and click then your
computer using browser as interface get attention to hit the required server using URI and if server is up you get their home page.

***Many waves already running in commuter when we click then sufficient waves get together and make single wave and  transmit to click place for further process***

***Attention is nothing but consolidated form of waves flow in certain direction***

Human brain is not simply the collection of mass but there are unlimited type of basic waves always transmitting(in/out) at a nano second in that mass.
There are unlimited number of waves wired there who keep mind in active state, When we observe our attention move in certain direction it not move simply but 
before move the sufficient number of waves come together and then make some arrangement, if arrangement get consolidated then only these all small group of 
waves become single waves known as attention and then it starts transmission/propagation in certain direction.

You can observe when you are doing something consciously and you feel some Itchy in your body, your attention suddenly get transmitted form your work to the 
Itching point of your body. In this process waves/consolidated waves not only transmitted  form your work to itchy point but also your feeling
get changed, this is due to rearrangement of wave architecture during transmission state. 

***If your attention is in distributed state then your waves within you always is in affinity to make it single/stabilize***
***Yogi's attention normally is in single state that'y they use almost all attention to do something***
