Why God/Almighty?
=====================================================
As per Spiritual people definition the power who control each and every thing is nothing but God.
If you realize scientifically then you know Every streaming/changes is under control of Time,Space,Energy and the transformation contentiously happen in energy.
Actually the Time/Space/Streaming in energy is coexistence for creation of any things known or unknown.

Then why God?
---------------------
In fact God is the emotional form of coexistence ie.. the feeling of that create the emotion.
If you realize the God in the form of coexistence then your emotion will be dry out.

***Coexistence is the base of every existence known or unknown***

For Non Spiritual human
-----------------------
There are many state of mind when human create emotion in them self's to normalize the situation.

1. If they are in extreme state of stress ie When they unable to find any path to come out from that stress state of mind 
ie Black out state of mind...then they leave everything on God.

***Leave energy break the flow of struggle/friction with self***

2. If they try hard to achieve some things but unable to achieve then they prey to god for their support.

3. Due to Greedy nature

4.If they feel light after some creation..then they say thanks to God.

The God mostly respond in the form of normalization of emotion since you also send the emotion to God.
In fact these emotions respond from your Inner Intelligence system only but not from any external source.

Spiritual human
------------------------
GURU use the concept of God To centralize the emotion/energy of transformation towards inner self so that they can meditate well.
Since the human try to search the God, their priority of search God is always on top and so most of their emotion/energy use that direction.
This is also a greedy and due to greedy nature very high emotion create that lead to heal in pain(heart that melt ego) or heal in delight depends up on their observation.

***High emotion have only caliber to drill the inner core of ego***
***If you know the any stuff that make you light since it touch coexistence only that is everywhere/anywhere***
***Except human non of lives ..God is neither any meaning nor its meaningless***
