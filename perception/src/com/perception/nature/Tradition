Tradition
================================
This is the transmission of customs or beliefs from generation to generation, or the fact of being passed on in this way.
It is the track that invent by some one in past or very past. It was much more flexible for them who had invented it because they had analysed much before invention.

Every tradition is much more flexible when it in spreed mode but as per nature the same thing look like different
in different environment.
Why should one follow tradition?
--------------------
On first glance if any thing makes you benefit/easy/happy for further movement, It is obvious any one will 
add in their account.

***Neither any tradition gives benefit nor any tradition harm****

Is is up to you...what you want to take the same have to pay in different angle.

***Neither any thing is fit for life nor any thing is unfit for life***

Nature(streaming)  never follow any thing.it is just in mode of stream.
----------
Every tradition makes a circumference for life, It may look like good or bad it is up to you.
But for inner journey each and every circumference evicts slowly on the way.

***Every circumference look like a boundary that force to fly under it only***
