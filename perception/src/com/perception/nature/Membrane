Membrane
===============================================
Membrane is the blocker to observe the energy in the form of streaming.
In other words one can observe the energy as it is or in the form
of streaming but due to membrane in our perception one never realize the object as it is.
Membrane take role for partition of energy in the form of object.

***Object never be as it is..but the contentious streaming of energy in object is as it is***

Due to membrane in perception only one makes partition in their realization.
When one realize truth since membrane take place role for separate the truth from untruth. 
When one realize delight the same moment membrane separate it form pain.
Realization of delight it self tell pain also exists.

Every one try to secure their membrane since because of it only one realize their existence.
The thickness of membrane is directly proportion to poor understanding.
It is neither very simple nor very hard to see our membrane.

***Membrane never gives chance to realize the energy in the form of streaming***
***Membrane is nothing but the poor observation***
