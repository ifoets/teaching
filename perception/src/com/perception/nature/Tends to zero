You break the time(the instance in which streaming/change perform),object(streaming energy in the form of mass),Space(container of mass/object) and your understanding on these together conteniously 

ex
initially T, O, S and U are time, object/energy,Space and your understanding

break 1
T=sum of (Ta)...,T=100000Ta
O=sum of(Oa)....,O=100000Oa
S=sum of (Sa)...,S=100000Sa

break 2
Ta=sum of (Tb)...,Ta=100000Tb
Oa=sum of(Ob)....,Oa=100000Ob
Sa=sum of (Sb)...,Sa=100000Sb

break 3

Tb=sum of (Tc)...,Tb=100000Tc
Ob=sum of(Oc)....,Ob=100000Oc
Sb=sum of (Sc)...,Sb=100000Sc

...so on
.
.
.
break till your understanding reach to vibrationl state(just floating of realization) of mind

you will realize Every things(T,O,S) never reach to state of zero(nothing)
since if it reach zero state, the reverse summation of existing time, space and object become zero.
That contradict the breaking initial (T/S/O).

***There is no limit smallest(molecule/space) and there is no limit to biggest(universe/space)
***There is no limit transformation of energy...it can recycle in trillion of light year
***Time is one of the part existence for existence of streaming/changes in energy(particle/wave/object)
***Space(pool of energy container) is one of the part of existence for keep the energy(particle/wave/object)
