Dimension(the direction of Perception)
====================================
One can perceive the object mostly two ways either how once want to perceive it or by the perception of observation.
In other words, Either once wishes perceive the object or the once observer perceive the object.

Perception due to wishes(ie ..lack of energy)
-----------------------------------------------------------
When once wishes perceive the object, the object reflect near to similar the wishes of one perceive. Since here one not perceive the object(action/reaction/..so) but one perceive its wishes in the object and the same wishes reflect back from object.
Ex-
If one perceive the nature is beautiful, it feel beautiful,
If the same perceive nature is rude(if some disaster happen near), it feel rude.
Here the wishes is the perception and the nature play the role in background.

Here there are infinite dimension of perception on single object by single energy since the dimension of perception directly emerge from the wishes of one.
So every one have their own dimension of perception on single object at any instance.
 
Perception by observer
----------------------------------------------------------------
The self(observer) don't have any intention to observe some thing. It don't have any input for observation. it just observe the nature/behavior of object. Depends up the powers of penetration, it observe the deeper/thinner layer of activity. 

Since observer don't have any input, the object reflect their nature/behaviors as it is.
So the dimension of perception for many observers are similar at certain level of perception and it differ after the deeper layer of perception. 
Ex-
if some one perceive nature as it is..ie by the way of observation. one not feel anything just observe/learn the natures of  nature

***Observation is the Nature of self***
***Self perception is feeling less***
