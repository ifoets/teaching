🌹🙏🌹***Echo System(Streaming)***🌹🙏🌹
=========================================
Echo  system is a atmosphere/architect/arrangement/decoration/action/reaction/structure...so on.. in any form(straight line/circular/spherical..so on..) that can able to reflect back the energy in similar fashion after collision, to the center from where it emerge/transmit.

Nature have infinite types of internet/intranet echo system. How one look/observe/action/reaction...so on..or whatever one does with  the nature, nature reflect back the similar one.
In fact nature may/may not responding from its echo system but the nature help to build the echo system in once thought and emotion and the reflection happen from there only and nature is just a interface to build the Echo System.

External Echo System
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here the energy directly reflect from external source of echo system.
Ex- 
-One makes dense intensity sound in well, it reflect back after collision to surface/water of well.
-One make dense intensity sound near a big pond in night, it reflect back the same.
-One create the fear in society
-One kind/helpful/engaged/....so on with society, it reflect back form the society.

Internal Mechanism
--------------------------
When one transmit the energy(any action/reaction) from some source, The energy transmission dissolve in atmosphere around it. If the intensity of energy is high it activate the energy in its atmosphere and the activated energy reflect back to the source from where it does transmit.
Ex-
-After nice speech of teacher/leader/guru/motivator/boss/...so on...The listener hands on, feel honor for them.
-Social worker/brave human/honest human/robber/terrorist/hero/role model/kind human/lovely human/king/servant/employee/boss/slimy child...so on...every one get reflection from atmosphere surrounded on them(Echo system)

Internal Echo system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the echo system make by one self using once thought and emotion with/without some external interface. The atmosphere of internal echo system is once thought/emotion ie understanding.
Ex- 
-One listen strange sound in his big dark room at night.
 The seed(sound) create many echo system in once thought/emotion.if one feel ghost/harmful object then once echo system make them fear and one try to save from them.

-One can understand, I m not any human, I am just a chemical structure.
-One can understand, I am the child of god.
-One can understand I am a soul and there are a supreme soul form where I connect.
-One can understand there is a birth after death.
-Once can understand these are my family.
-Once can understand I came on earth for some experience. ------One can understand there is not god exists. 
-One can understand I am just a stream of energy.
-One can understand I am not exists.
-One can understand every thing in this universe is just the stream of energy only....so on... 

The above examples are the internal echo system that invent/create by once thought/emotion(inner/outer)/observation/feeling/understanding based on their frequency of energy exists in one self.

There are nothing any truth/untruth here..there are just the reflection from once inner echo system...ie how does one make their understanding/feeling/thought internally.

Internal Mechanism
--------------------------
Depends up the density of energy in one self, the thought/emotion/feeling/understanding...so on.. ie. the energy of one self activate on higher frequency and that can make its own echo system for it action/reaction..ie reflection.

How one make energy in one self doesn't matter...just need of energy only.

***What one understand/feel, that one become***
