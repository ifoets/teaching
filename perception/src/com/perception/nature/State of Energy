Current state of energy
====================================
Whatever we do it depends up on the experience/knowledge with us.
Every work done depends up our experience/knowledge but if you observe the process of work at every intermediate time depends on you current state of energy.
If we have sufficient energy during process of work, we can move smoothly. In the state of sufficient energy we automatically unable to look towards
completion of work but we stay at the process of work.

But at the same time if we have insufficient energy at current state, Even we have full experience and knowledge, we process the work in little hindrance mode.

***Not only experience/knowledge but also the current state of energy is valuable in the process of action***

Ex-
It is just like plant is green/healthy and its flower is in the sate of grow but sky have full of cloud ie..plant unable to get sunlight during grow of flower,
you can observe flower take more time and the intensity on surface of flower is less than usual day.

If you are in fasting sate ie..currently you stop the direct energy supply. Even every thing is as usual in current state of life but you can observe you physical
movement slightly decrease the smooth flow.

If you have experience of silence,meditation,yoga but if you have currently insufficient energy you can observe these event not process in smooth ways.

***Current state of energy always make us to move in smooth ways instantly***

Even you are a good human being and you have good experience of living your life but if you are currently in tense mode, you may observe your behavior is slightly differ than usual life, Your voice slightly flow in unwanted direction.

***Current sate of energy attach with current state of mind***

You can observe due to lack of energy in current sate, how do we feel with nature/romantic songs/interaction that feeling slightly change.

***Not the experience/knowledge but the current state of energy that make you heal in current state***
