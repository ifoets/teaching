Partition
==============================================
Partition is the stuff by which our angle of perception reflect differently.
Relativity is the base of partition or in other words  due to poor understanding partition automatically invent.

Why our perception make partition?

It is because of we try to advancement towards positive energy and try to realize our self better.
Trying and Adjusting are themselves a management and doing management means it already not managed or look something non manage.
Manage and non manage both are same thing but due partition only it look different.

**Neither energy is positive nor energy is negative...Energy is just energy***
Ex-
Due to this partition we realize something is truth some where and something this is untruth here.
Some thing is wrong here and something is right their. Some one is saint their and some one is robber here.
Some one is honest there and some one is dishonest here.

***Neither any thing is truth nor any thing is untruth***

Ex- One searching/realizing truth since it has understanding about untruth.

***Neither things are hidden nor things are open***

It is once poor perception/understanding makes things hidden or open.

Until one observe differently unless one realize ...just stuffs are being.

***Feeling/realization override the thought and understanding neither override nor overlap the thought and feeling***
***Digging of earth tell about the thirsty nature and exception of water***
