Society(....Streaming Society....)
===========================
Society is the arrangement of human beings under particular constitution(A set of rules under them they have to survive).
A social human brain work under many concentric constitutions/principle. 
One have own principle->friend principle->Male/Female principle->family principle->office/business principle->local society principle->Village principle->Area principle->District->cast->state->country->religion-> human right ...so on.

There are four pillar on which society exists
Need
Expectation
Communication
Unnatural Feeling(attachment)

If one feel their  need/expectation can be fulfill by others, they are capable to build the society quickly.
One can observe we build society for our self in every mill second of time.
The above four pillar is the center from where the waves expanded spherically and society take a shape automatically.
If one think for others, relate with others, compete with other,help others, exchange with others, communicate with others...so on....Whatever/Wherever the way by which one
interact with other human being, it built society automatically for them. But it come in picture when it tightly bounded and one try to extend from the boundary of society.

Every society have a life(the time in which it exists), the society moves in their youngest age when it become very tight and create stress for humans.

The above event happen due to poor understanding for balancing of life.One not balanced with one self they cant balance with any of the society since there unbalance presence is enough to unbalance the society made by them.
Social human's brain get hindrance for inner self growth.

***One balance with self, then One can balance anywhere***
