A state of Normalization
=========================
Each and every lives use the state of nomalization during their activities/journey of life/movement on path. Normalization is the intermidate state of energy 
during some task/process are in progress where lives realize to change the current waves structure into another waves sturcture to recollect the energy for further
process.

In other words lives keep the action in running state with bit little less use of energy and collect the bit energy for further state of process.
It is just like small recharging for further proccess.

Ex-
-Have you been observed when the eagle/vulture fly in sky, you may observe it move the fang some time and some time it keep the fang in static mode, to keeping the fang
in static mode is nothing but normalization of its fly.

-When you sweem contineouly, you many observe after some time you feel tired and you make swimming bit slow,in this little bit slow you normalizaing the swimming for further
swim.

Normalization in external life
---------------------------------------------
When we start new critical/comlex journey(new job/business/ralation/invention/creation), normally we feel it is diffcult and many times it seems to be diffecult to move 
this pat.This is becuuse before our mind set/emotion was in differnet state and during journey our state getting change into some differnet state, if we able to understand
the streaming of nature/streaming of life/streaming of moment/streaming of thought/emotion/understanding then our thought/emotion never goes in the direction it seems to
be very diffcult/diffcult but it relaize the state is gatting change so we have to accept the new state. Or we have to just look why it seems to be diffcult.

If we don't have any option during diffculties then there is one option always in hand just to look and let it be flow as it is flowing, dont try to fight with it, how much
you can support your self you must support.
In between journy you can normalize by little less engaging with activities. You can look the person who getting lot of diffculties in theri life but evern they never
loose the patience, they normalize and again move on the same path.

***Neither any things/situation is diffcult nor it is easy but we anable to accept the changes that why it seems to be easy/diffcult***

Normalization in spiritual life/journey within
----------------------------------------------
Journey witin is very long process of life and due to contineous supply of energy within human(energy within) get more and more transformation. Many time they aware and many
times they unawaress about their state of energy transformation. Due to awarness/unawarness they might get much more pain and much more healing. If they aware about the process
of normalization then the same pain/healing can get normalize for further journey.

There are many ways spriritual human normalize them self
-Cry with the bottom of heart in alone and reove all the emotion that unable to get stable structure of waves.
-They leave practiving  meditiona/yoga/silence for some days/weeks and trying to observe what the effect of these activiteis in life, in this way their attention get in another
 direction and energy also get reduce.
-They write/share their experiecne evern they know non spiritual people unable to get anytings.
-They take long breath and keeping thir patience like will see next.
-They can realize there must be further journey and that will be more and more excited.
-They recall the previous transformation and what they realize during that.
-They share with their emotion to some another spiritual human being.
so on

***In Journey within unlimited no of adventurous transformation happen and every transoformatio making them to prepare for next one***
