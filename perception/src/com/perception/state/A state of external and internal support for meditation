A state of external/internal support for meditation
================================================
Every human being perceive many action in their entire life of journey. Many action has been for sort time, many action has been for long time, many action process in chaining,
many action discontinue in intermediate, many action reach to their purpose, many action has lost their purpose but in state of continue, many action change their direction based of experience at intermediate,many action process by using track their next direction of path using previous experiences..so on

But the purpose/center of every action to get energy/ satisfaction/ peace/happiness only in either ways, it is different thing that this energy is useful for surface of mind/intellect/heart
/wisdom/activation of inner abstract energy/breaking the threshold or some specific activities..so on.

Meditation is a taskless/senseless task that always perceive in chaining fashion and it drive its path using its own 
experiences/tracking system at each and every stage of life.
It always need/utilize/require fresh energy to keep in state of chaining/fresh perceiving that also emerge due to meditation/ breathing yoga/silence types of task or similar types of activities.
Due to fresh energy utilization by meditation it has only one step in every step of chaining that is nothing but its current state. It doesn't care about the previous steps or past steps.

As like each and every task there are many set of of process run in their internal mechanism and hence similar types of process also run in state of meditation internally.

The difference between taskless task (meditation) and any other work is here nothing to do by your senses/ mind/ intellect/ wisdom...it perceive automatically..ie is in light state
where as any other task require the use of senses/ mind/ intellect/wisdom..so on ie need some/more energy to perceive.

External support for meditation
--------------------------------
External support of meditation is nothing but we require some energy from external source. It might be useful at initial stage of meditation since at initial state it is not in any light state. It need some spark to realize its energy system.

Ex-
Using the external context like reading the spiritual book,listening spiritual audio,looking spiritual video, sitting/ meeting with saint/master/yogi/visiting spiritual places/
following masters/following nature/analyse the masters experiences/relate one master from anthers/search the best master/suspicion on self...etc comes under this category.
The purpose behind looking external support is nothing but trying to spark themselves.
Or if you got stuck at any intermediate state then also we look to any external source if we have lack of patience, if we have a little experience on previous state and have solid patience then your internal support is enough to get out from the stuck point.
This is  nothing but the external support of meditation.
At this state we feel good to use the external context since it gives a drop of energy without any work out just have to go through the external context.

Ex-
It is like external source had created food/experiences for them self and we want to eat/use it, This is not right place/phase where we can eat/experience others contexts
but we can smell the context of others. Smelling of food/utilizing the experiences of others is not enough to drive the life in smooth phase.

***External support for meditation is not enough to fly in sky having storm***
***External support for meditation is for sparking only, it not for drive every moment of life***

Internal support for meditation
--------------------------------
If you use internal support for meditation first of all your state should be in some what in light state where your believe system rotate inside within you mostly,
you should have high level of patience,you are ready to wait, you are in state that make you ready to suffer, you are ready to pay/work out, your believe system engage within you.
your perception/observation/realization.. are in such a state that understand uniqueness traversal of waves ie.. perception..so on.

At this state you interest to use external context is diminished, Due to understanding of uniqueness of perception you never relate once perception to another one.
Neither you give weight nor you refuse others/yours perception. At this state you always use fresh energy for meditation. At this state adventurous in feeling not make you feel fear but you take it as usual. At this state your get bounded with self. At this state your life is in mode of smoothness.Look here and their getting diminish slightly.
This is nothing but the internal support for meditation.

***If you are enough to prepare your food, Why should one look to others food for drive the life***
***Almost all yogi stat their meditation from external support and after certain period of time their state transformed into internal support for meditation***
