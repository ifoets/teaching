A state of strange with event
=============================
Not only each and every streaming /atoms /molecules /objects/energy/lives.. but also every instance of nature are in their rhythm of streaming. If one look at least at the state
of energy/waves flow/exchange of energy/creation of objects then every things look like obvious. You can't realize any strange, you can't expect rather the flow of energy,
Since every things is almost in your observation. Neither you touch the flow nor you try to do something with flow of waves/energy since what should be do by energy the same
thing it always in state of doing/streaming.

If your perception bounded by lives/object then you can look in the perception of peace/development/relax.. but if your perception match with streaming of energy then everything is as
it is/every thing was as it is/every thing will as it is.It is the existence of nature.

If one not able to realize the flow of energy then only they create the deviation towards their enhancing of energy, If energy flow towards you deviation they automatically
you feel good but if the flow of energy/waves against your deviation then you automatically realize the sad/stress.

***Deviation towards object/event is the seeds of strange***
***If you are not with streaming of energy then you are with object/lives***

Event is summation of states of flow of waves/energy and state is a summation of streaming of waves/energy. When you are able to observe the streaming of waves/energy the every
state or event look like obvious.

****Not only events but also states are obvious only,we unable to observe that is different things***

If we are out of control with some event means before get it uncontrolled we have suppressed our waves/feeling/energy in control and that is unnatural since during controlled we
suffered and when it become uncontrolled you feel nice. 
When we suppress our energy/waves or flow beyond the streaming of waves in both scenario the waves/energy get disarranged and due to this disarrangement the same waves try to create
the structure of stable arrangement.
The disarrangement is nothing but lack of stability of energy within us and this is nothing but creation of wishes towards stability ie expectation.

***The stream state of energy can look the streaming of energy, but it can't do anything since it look like obvious***
***You cry since the event goes opposite to you expectation/lack of energy***
***You feel happy/strange since the event goes towards your fulfill of energy/gap/space***
