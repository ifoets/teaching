A state of suppress the active energy/waves
===========================================
Humans mind always in search of energy using senses every where when it realize even a drop of energy it try to absorb the same, but because of lack of understanding it never find some concrete/abandon source of energy, it try to maximize the search by looking others human being activity. If it influence from some one they try to follow them but even after certain period time they get this is also not sufficient for them. This process happening all most entire life of journey.
 
 The significance of energy collect from external source
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Whatever energy our senses/mind collect form external source is nothing but instance of energy. It will never become the sufficient one. Many time we collect the energy from external source and the same energy we use to activate our feeling this is nothing but imagination towards source or analysis of source energy. Some time we get some feeling or some time we get more feeling..
 
 When we get more feeling our mind take interest into that object/source, It try to dig more and more since it is thirsty for energy.After digging more and more our feeling get activated more and more.
 
 When we feel good means the energy get activated are in arranged form and when we feel bad means the energy get activated in in disarranged form and this energy try to perceive towards maximum stabilization due its nature, if you have good understanding then you can transform it in many activity
but if you have not good understanding then you cant stop here rather then you make it suppress.
 
 This is nothing but suppress of active energy/waves
 
 Energy always exists in state of flow/streaming it may be in rapid or it may be in slow but it exists in the form of stream only, if you don;t give option for flow then it will break the threshold and try to flow towards stabilization, If you let them flow then ok otherwise if you try to stop then it create the fight between mind and energy this is nothing but the tens.
 
Suppress of energy means we try to capture it in small space, when space decrease the molecule of energy try to break the boundary with more strength for flow and it seems to
 respond back the suppress.
 
 How much we suppress the active energy that much the same accumulated energy suppress us in opposite direction since it need stability.
 
 The strength of oath is also a type of suppression of active energy but here due to high strength of oath first energy try to break the threshold and after many try
 if energy don;t find any path then finally it use the energy that come with pressure and transform it for their stabilization and finally make a special structure between their molecule that gives the stability.
 
 ***Energy is for only transformation since it is its existence, if we do any other activity with energy, it may create stress***
