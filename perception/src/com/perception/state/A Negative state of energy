A negative/positive state of energy
=========================================
Every object exists due to streaming state of energy injected in that. Without energy the existence of mass will is like existence of space without time.
Energy is the game changer on top of coexistence.

Not only object buts also your mind/body/intellect..so on stream due to state of energy injected into that.
Science define energy as the capacity of work done, but spirituality defined the same as the existence of stuff due to that every instance of universe are in under form/state of
stream.

Energy is just the existence of stream, it neither be positive nor it be negative.Negative and positive are the are also some state of energy in your angle of your perception.
In fact, In One angle of perception an energy look like positive but the same energy look like negative in another angle of perception.

Ex-
-When some one give you Sympathy, you realize he is positive human but when you understand sympathy is most dangerous for inner journey the same person look like negative for you.

-When some one provide security for you,you realize he is positive for you but when you know this  security make you more insecure then the same person look like negative.

-When your family support you, you realize they are positive but when you realize pain form them/interface, you realize the same one are negative. 

Ie. when an energy work productive for you/making you chill/making you heal/making you cool/making you energetic, you realize the energy as positive energy but when the 
same energy at same state make you destructive/ tense/ harmful/heart..so on you realize the same state of energy is negative.

***Neither any energy be in positive state nor be in negative state, it is you who make their state positive/negative***

***Energy just exists in some state since it is in being forever/streaming***

Ex-
-When fire cook your food,it look like positive energy but when the same fire burn your house it look like negative energy.

-When you are thirsty the water is most positive and when the same water flood your family it look like negative.

***Not only the energy but also the action due to energy be neither positive nor be negative, it is just your angle of perception who makes it***

It may be possible an energy change its state, you realize the previous state of energy is positive and later state of energy is negative or vice versa, but it  totally depends on
your utilization of the state of energy or your angle of perception towards the state of energy.
 
It may be possible one state of energy(A) attract/affinity or repulse to another state of different energy(B), it not means A is positive and B is negative or vice versa.
 
 Ex- 
 -Male feel affinity with female vice versa, it not mean male is positive and female is negative or vice versa, but male and female just are in such a state they feel affinity with each others.
 -Electron(e) have affinity with Positron(p), it not meas electron is negative and positron is positive energy but these are the state of energy in such a state they feel affinity
 with each others.
 Here the wave emerges in election going away from electron and the wave emerge in position is coming towards positron and hence when electron  come near positron both pull each
 others.
 
 Positive(p) and Negative(e) are just the nomenclature of state of energy for further study.
 
 Ex-
 -X is not the negative and +X is not the positive but the both -X and +X are nothing but the transformed form(a state) of zero(0)
 ie when you supply X(energy) to zero the zero only transferred to X and when take X(energy) form zero the zero only transformed to -X.
 So -X/+X is just the state of zero not the negative/positive.
 
 ***Segregation of positive and negative(nomenclature) state of energy cant change change their state but it can change your direction of approach***
