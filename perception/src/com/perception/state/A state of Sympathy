A state of Sympathy
===================================
Every state of energy is just in their state of stream. It neither have any initialization/purpose nor it have any destination.
The streaming of energy is not due to its nature but due to its existence. Not only energy/mass but also its base(coexistence) exists in the form of stream.
In other words one can say their properties perceive in different dimension but the base of perceiving is only the streaming in it.

Our heart/organs is also just an object and the wave/energy flow in it(streaming in it) have neither any purpose. It is different things we use the streaming in heart with some
purpose(observation/realization/feeling). It is also a different thing that you feel good/bad/stress/healing/greedy/lust even the base of feeling these stuffs due to a state
of energy in heart.

The state of energy in our heart is one thing and whatever you feel is completely different stuff. Our feeling depends up on our approach towards the streaming of energy in our heart.

Ex-
If you have high energy(a state of energy) in your heart obviously you feel emotional at ever moment of life.
How do you feel by this emotion is nothing but your approach towards the emotion.
If your approach is against the emotion , you may feel high pain in your heart.
If you approach is towards the emotion, you may feel healing in your heart.

ie. State of energy is one thing and utilization of that state of energy is completely different thing.

***A state of energy/streaming in energy doesn't have any purpose,but one can use the sate in some purpose ***

Similar way the feeling of need of Sympathy/give the Sympathy is not the state of energy streaming in our heart but it is state of ours who realize the need/provide the same.
Ya but the state of emotion/energy streaming in our heart at the time of need/provide Sympathy is in different state than the normal state of feeling/streaming.

Ex-
If you give Sympathy to some one(X), it depends up on the approach of X how they take it. It depends up on their understanding/approach.
In normal human life if they are in state of pain, they take it as a ignited energy to reduce their pain since they don't understand the recycle of energy, they don't understand this
is just for an instance,they don't understand this energy reduce the intensity of breaking some threshold/digging/observation/reading the scenario.

But when you observe a sensitive human being, they neither believe to give any Sympathy or to take Sympathy, since they understand this is just a drop of energy and their effect
is instantly in you, they understand this is the base of attachment too, they understand this dangerous for their inner journey, they understand it try to keep engage in crowd.
They understand this is to reduce the melting state..so on
Only at very extreme state of pain they give Sympathy to some one, at the place of Sympathy sensitive human show/realize you a path one which you can move smoothly.

***To give something is your choice but one take it or not its their choice***
***If none can help you then you automatically take help from your abstract internal energy only***
