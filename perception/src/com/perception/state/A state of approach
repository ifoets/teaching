A state of approach
================================
If you want to understand/know something, you have to dig it till you can dig.
And the state of digging is not only depends on your stage of consciousness but also it depends on your angle of approach.

One get the realization based on their angle of approach. Whatever one get from their digging/observation is neither less nor more/neither right nor wrong.
But one having some purpose just before start the digging/approaching.
In fact there is some purpose(abstract energy) hidden behind the digging.

Ex- Let us object is X( you can select any object that give you best realization)..Flower
State of approach(A)
When normal human being look some object(X) their approach towards object to fit in their life/reduce their need by using that object,
They dig not only the use of object but also they dig where it will be most fit-able.

When a social human look the same object X their approach towards object is to fit in society, They dig the place/culture/environment 
in society where it will be most fit-able for society.

When a pharmaceutical scientists look the same object X their approach towards object to make the drug and how to make the best drug from this object.

When child look the same object X their approach towards the object how to enjoy with object, they dig the way of enjoyment using that object.

When a old person look object X their approach to share their experience to young generation or to tell about the object ot young generation.

When a scientists of physics look the object X, their approach towards object to observe/read/write/understand their external behavior.

When a  scientists of chemistry look the same object X, their approach towards object to observe their internal structure/internal behavior of molecule inside it.

When a spiritual human look the same object their approach is to know the object, they not only try to observe their behavior  but also they try to know internal streaming
inside it, They break the object in the form of stream by using observation. Their approach towards the existence of the object.

From above example one can realize different human get different things form the same object since their angle of approach towards object is different
Their purpose of approach is different and they not only rich to different state but also they travel/stream/dig in different direction.

***Neither any approach is right nor any approach is wrong but just their meaning/purpose/angle of approach are different***
