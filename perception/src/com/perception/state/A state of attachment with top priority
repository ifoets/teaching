A state of attachment with top level of priority
=============================== ========
All most Every human being having one/more top level of priority in their life. It may changing time to time based on our observation.
It is based on our understanding/level of energy in us we select our priories. Whatever we realize for maximum balance of life we select them for top level of priority in Other words from where we gating maximum energy that stuff normally
we select our top level of priority.

-Some one of us realize due to their profession only we gating money for survival of life then they give maximum priority to their profession.
-Some one of us realize due to honesty we get respect in their life and if respect is maximum source of energy they keep honesty at on top level in their priorities.
-Some of of us realize due to balancing in our family we keep out of stress and our priority to balance the family is on top.
-Some of us realize due to travelling we getting maximum relaxation in our life so their priority to travel is on top.
-Some of us realize money is the center of happiness and if they realize we can buy(that make us happy)everything by money then their top level of priority to earn the money maximum as much possible.
-Some of us realize due to keeping our self in light state their top level of priority to keep joking in their life on top level.
-Some one us realize meditation/yoga/silence..so on is the center of healing/energy in their life they keep these activity on top of their priority.
-Some of us gating maximum energy in watching movie/eating testy food/playing/singing/managing..so on.. ie from where one get realize the maximum of source of energy they
keep the source on top level of priority.

When we move with our top level of priority, we keep moving with it since we gating more and more energy. The energy is light or dense that is different things.
Or recognition of intensity of energy is different matter.
Since we get maximum interest in our top level of priority since gating maximum energy, we keep moving blindly on certain path that making internal pattern.

If the energy gating in our top level of priority having very high intensity then due to high level of intensity of energy our abstract/internal energy get activated.
And due to activation of our abstract/internal energy we get power of observation and power of realization..so on.
Due to power of observation/realization get increased we moving in light state day by day and hence our bound with top level of priority become light day by day.

Have you been observed what happen if the energy gating in our top level of priority have low level of intensity ie means it have not caliber to melt the abstract/internal
energy, its behavior is completely opposite. We feel attachment with our top level of priority after certain period of time since our bound with top level of priority 
gating tight day by day.

***The center is the energy but the intensity of energy, that makes light or tight bounding***
***Attachment is nothing but the tight bounding***
Ex-
-A player play entire life and they enjoying much to play, they never get any internal transformation from inside, if they fail in their game, they feel high stress due to tight bounding only.
-A actor have very crazy to acting, they have been doing acting entire life but have been observe any valuable changes/transformation due to acting in their life but when they get failure they realize high stress this is due to tight bounding only.
-A person looking video of adventure/master statement/listing songs long period of time..so on they might feel attachment after certain period of time.
-A Priest worshiping god of stone, they feel attachment after certain period of time.
so on.
-A yogi also practice meditation/yoga/silence and they have also these activity in top level but have you been observe they are in stress state, they can get hearten many time for very sort period of time this is due to activation of certain point.
but they very rarely come in state of stress. Why? 
This is due to light bounding with their top level of priority.
Here not the player,actor or yogi making bounding tight or light but the intensity of energy only play internal game during travelling on path of top level of priority.

***Gatling continuous energy is not big deal but the intensity of energy is the matter***
***Every external source of energy never provide you high level intensity energy since you depends on external source***
***All most all internal source of energy provide you high level of intensity energy since it completely depends on you/your work out with your self since there is no any success/failure here***
