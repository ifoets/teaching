A state engage in interfaces
===========================
Every things in this universe engage with another things this is nothing but existence/nature/streaming.
Engagement of one stuff with another stuff is due to affinity towards stability or reformation of stability in different form.

Every stuff in front of us having different states of energy/ frequency but our engagement always perceive with co states only. Every activity emerge many types of energy/waves having different types of their frequency but what energy/ frequency state we looking/expecting for that energy/waves we can receive since our states try to find their co state and when it find, it engage with that only.

ie means our receiver/state detect the frequency that it needed even the source emerge different types of frequencies.
This is states of energy/waves who having affinity for their co state for next steps of stability but our poor understanding come in picture as an interface and this interface seems to be another interface/object from where energy/waves transmission perceive.

Ex-

RE:-state of receiving energy inside object
RO:-state of receiving object(mind/senses/observation) and interface
TO:-transmission object, an interface
TE:-state of transmission of energy form inside object

(RE) <=> [RO<=>TO] <=> TE 

Assume X is dancing and singing and Y is looking dance and listen songs of X.
When X are in dancing state, X transmit different types of energy/waves, X may transmit following type of energy/waves

A- Showing nature of dancer X transmitting an energy
B- Different organs/parts of Body of X transmitting energy
C- The movement of their body parts transmitting energy
D- The flow of waves when body of X in rhythm during dance transmitting energy
E- The heart of X transmitting energy
F- The state of devotion of X for dance transmitting energy
G- Singing state transmitting energy
H- The tuning wave of singing when it make heal to some one transmitting energy/waves
..so on 
There are unlimited types of waves transmission arise in X during a state of dancing/singing, it depends up the state of energy in Y that receive their co state of energy.

Here not X but the energy state inside/in X are under transmission of energy and not Y but the energy state inside/in Y who receive energy.
But due to our poor understanding we engage with object/ and it create interface of self and object from there it receive energy.
X and Y just come in picture as interfaces between exchange of energy transmit and receive from within X and Y.

In above A,B,C,D..... states of energy/waves transmission By X and IF States of energy within Y is:-
A- In very low state then Y influence of showing nature of X
B- In state that make attention to body of X then Y receive waves from body of X.
C- In state that observe the dancing quality even little then its attention on waves that body movement of X makes
D- In state to observe/feeling the art of dancing then Y flow with flow of X when X are in rhythms of dance.
E- In state of emotion then Y may receive the heart feeling of X
F- In state of devotion then Y receive some devotional waves
so..on

***poor understanding always makes interfaces between energy transformation/transmission***
***It is the state of receiver that whatever energy/waves it receive***

***Every things is in front of you only but you can interact the things/states only that are in your state***
