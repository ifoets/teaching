A sate of waves/Significance of waves
======================================
Not only the lives but also the each every object are surrounded by the very very complex arrangement of waves.
If fact each and every object transform from one form into another form(ie in Nature) due to streaming in waves.

Not only the on the surface of object but also inside each and every molecule inside the objects having waves in very rapid motion and this rapid motion of waves inside object is responsible for every activity/ transformation/ movement..so on..of object.
In fact every object/mass are sink in different types waves.

Every human being connected each other due to wave, Our planets seems to be in order due to waves,Our pattern is a form of waves, Our circumference is a form of waves.
Our society form waves, Our country form waves, Science form a waves,Our religion form waves, Political party form waves, Discipline form waves, Right forms waves..so on

Your senses/ mind/ feeling/ observation/ realization/ understanding/ streaming of energy attachment/jealous/ delight/ pain/happiness/sad/frustration/greedy/lust..so on follow some pattern and the architecture/mechanism behind that pattern is nothing but arrangement of waves only in particular fashion.

***Waves is nothing but the pure form of energy separated from mass***
***Mass is alone meaningless without waves, it is just like without time and space object is meaningless***

When scientist detect the waves and they understand the reason behind each and every activity of objects is nothing but due to waves/arrangement of waves only.
They start to play with waves and a new revolution came in human lives.

You see the mobile/ internet/ satellite/ websites/ software /electrics /electromagnetic devise..so on..they get controlled from waves only.

*** Not only the intensity of waves but also the arrangement/ design/architecture of waves affect the change the actions***

When waves are in non design form it become destructive and we says this is negative energy, in fact it is neither negative/ positive energy but a state of energy have not
any specie arrangement and they need to form some specific arrangement so they pull some extra energy and form where it pull(where it find the weakness in bound) that place feel
lack of energy.

Ex-
When a crowed gather in some Mela they each have separate purpose to enjoy there ie all energy are distributed and as group of all human in Mela haven't any big meaning,
But when the same group of people move in some movement then all of them have a single purpose and it create a wave, it become so powerful it can make hindrance to a stable government/ origination.

When the same group of people come in war against some country they are have single purpose in aggregation mode it form a different intensity wave and it can win/damage the other country.

Ex-When some critical situation happen in some country the all people in that country have similar emotion for their country and these emotions form a wave, and it can do some big task for their county.

Ex- Ruling of a government form a wave to control the humans, here the wave form by using the set of rules/ disciplines/systems/subsystem/micro systems/rights..so on.

***If we don't know the waves emerges inside us then we simply flow/fight with it and when we know then we can observe/flow/play with it***
