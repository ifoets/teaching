A state distributed waves/attention
====================================
Not only the energy but also their intensity is valuable to doing action. If one think they did well but their output is not matching to their action, it is due to lack of understanding or lack of concept of energy. How much we supply energy exactly that much output will come in front you/us. In this scenario either we given more value of our action or pulled towards the result of action. It means we didn't focus on what energy we supplied in that action.

If at a time we have to do many action or our mind is in process of different action then the energy of attention get distributed. If one have caliber to do many action together
then there is no any problems but if one can't process many task simultaneously then they should to show their daring to leave some task and should proceed the one important task.

***None of the task is important except that the task we select at a time****

Every humans being do only single task at a time since they don't have many hand and many mind together to do but they think/process all task simultaneously. If one think many task 
simultaneously they are not in process of resolving all at a time but they are fighting with all problems together. This is very poor ways to step up.
And due to this approach they lose the energy and reach in such low state that they feel a single task in front of them is also complex.
This is due to lack of energy only.
This is due to hindrance or lack of confidence or lack of understanding due to which we simply we distribute/burn our energy simply before even start of single task.
How we distribute energy/attention of waves is doesn't matter but matter is it get distributed without resolving any single task.

****Remember/it need to understand, it is not you but the state of energy within you have caliber to resolve any task***
***You can engage with many task simultaneously but you will do only single task at a time***

How to reduce the distribution of energy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many ways to reduce the distribution of energy some of them are in below explanation.
But overall this happen due to lack of understanding/lack of sensitivity/lack of experience.

1- Queued out task and target on the task who are in front of queue. Remember you have only one task in front of you on that you can give full attention of-course to resolve
only one task get more probability to resolve quickly and better ways. Keep in attention every task who are in queue will come automatically in front of us one by one.

2- The task is more complex and giving more pressure to resolve them take that in first priority. When the complex task get resolve then it give confidence to other less complex task.

3- Priorities task clearly and focus on them with their priority at a time.

Note:- Above 3 ways are nothing but the management of task and reduce of unwanted distribution of  energy but this not entire life solution.
You need to absorb/supply more and more energy is the one most better approach since these energy guide/lead you in proper dynamic ways. The above 3 approach is just for stop
distribution of energy not for production of energy and you will manage only that much energy how much you have.

***It is need to understand We are going to resolve only one problem at a time then why make all problem in process at a time***

Specially Spiritual human understand they have only one task for them self in their entire life and that always in his on top of their priority. Other any task they look like game even
the external task is gating completed easily since they have high energy and their understanding are in concrete position.

***To arrange/design energy in particular/particular ways is just temporary solution but even it will helpful little/more***
***Supply more and more energy to yourself is the solution of entire problems in life since not you but energy within you attack on problem***
