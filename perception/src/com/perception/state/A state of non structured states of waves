 A non structured state of wave
 =========================================
 Before transmission of any waves/energy it get some specific stable internal structure, Before transformation/reformation into stable structure their internal molecules get activated 
and  Before get activated the internal molecules it need supply of energy.
 
 There are many ways/path we supply energy to within and it depends up the supply of energy only the intensity of internal molecules of waves get activated.
 
 One categories the top two paths form where our energy get activated little or more
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
Any stability or non stability comes in picture when the energy are in active state. When energy are in sleeping state then there is no any meaning for stability or non stability.
 
 Ex- Someone one stay in jungle alone there is no any meaning of stability or non stability of any society/culture/relation/business for them since they are in sleeping state with respect to 
society/culture/relation/expectation..so on.
 
 1-From external source
 ===========================
 a. Opposite to our streaming
 -----------------------------
 When your boss/ honor/ government/ wife/ husband/ relative/ closer..so on force/pressurize/harm/scold/crush/exploit.etc you then the waves created by them touch on the surface of
mind in first site, if our understanding level is higher than the waves can get truncated easily.
But if our understanding level is poor then our mind unable to make it light and our internal energy/molecules get activated in non structured state. 
Since we are not ready to accept the above activities so it is difficult to transform the non structured state of molecules into structured state of molecules(wave).
At this state our non structured energy trying to find the path from where it get form a waves ie for its stability(for human this is satisfaction)
It can look towards revenge,it can look to some one similar human/energy to connect with them.
 
 Ex-
-When A government crush to a group of peoples, all people's energy get activated in non structured ways and they connect themselves together to make a new big form of non structured wave to fight with government. it may transform into movement.
Here you look a government but unable to look the waves hidden in their policy and you able to look the humans but unable to look the energy who get activated in the mind/ heart of humans.
 
-When a group of birds sitting around each others and you make them force to fly by throwing a stone then they are not ready to fly together, they try to save their alone life and they fly randomly and it is difficult to make a stable waves.
 
 ***Any one can activate the energy but non can stop the energy to make a structure for creation of waves, since this is nature of energy***
 ***A non structure state of wave what do in next step for their stability it difficult to predict***
 
 b. In direction of our streaming
 ---------------------------------
When some one fulfill your expectations/Some one help you/Some one serve you/some one make you laugh/some one take care you/some one love you/some one
makes you healthy/ so on.
Then here your energy not only get activated but it also form a stable waves and hence you feel good. Since in this scenario you are in state of acceptance you/your energy take it as supply of similar types of energy.

2-From internal source/self
=============================
 
 a. Having awareness
 ---------------------
 If we get energy form our internal source, we have little or more awareness about the same since we don't get energy form our internal source simply/easily but for that we having working out day by day and it is not sudden energy like external source of energy. So when the molecules of our energy within get activated we are almost in state of ready to accept it and hence it is easy to transform in to stable wave structure and hence we feel healing.
 
 Ex-
When a a group of birds stat flying they all one by one come together since they are ready to fly together and makes a stable structure of waves
 b. Having Unawareness
 ---------------------------------
When we are unaware about the state change from one structure of waves to another structure of waves(transformation form one state to another state) then we get stuck during reformation/restructure of waves and that time we suffer a lot.
 
 ***It is easy to activate the energy on surface of mind by some external source but it is difficult to transform into waves***
 ***it is tough to activate energy by self but when it get activated then it is some what easy to make structure of waves***
 ***It is a poor state of energy(from surface of mind) who apply force to another energy***

***One can force humans not the energy since by nature it restructure it self in stable state and what effect get to humans
energy don't care***
