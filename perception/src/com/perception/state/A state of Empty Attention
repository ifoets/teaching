   A state of Empty Attention
================================================
Attention is focus/touch/pointer of brain system, by using of this attention brain/attention see/look/listen/smell/observe the stuff around it. When body are not in sleeping/meditating
state it obviously have some attention, it is just like if touch is on then it have some focus point where it is currently focusing. If you are in dark then you can see that area where touch is currently focusing. It not means that the focusing area only exists but due to light we can look/see/observe that area only that moment. As touch can't focus many area at a time similar way our attention also can't focus many problem/ situation/ complexity at a time.

It is not our senses but the attention who look/see/observe the stuff around it, senses is just like bulb in touch who help to provide light so our senses are just an interface for our attention. Many stuff are around you and your eye is open then your eyes works like bulb but what you looking/seeing is depends up on your attention only.

The attention may be poor/light/heavy/deep/ that depends up the state of energy running within you. It is just like touch focus the area but the intensity of light come out that depends up on the power of battery in touch.

It is just like you read/listen some thing then you will understand based on state of energy streaming within you in other word it depends up the capability of your understanding.

Empty Attention
--------------------
At a moment your attention is on object/energy X then your attention is EMPTY for every infinite thing except the object/ energy X. It means at that moment every thing in this world have no any meaning for you except the object/energy X(at that instance). In other words your attention is EMPTY for every thing in this  universe except for that object/energy X at that instance.

Wherever your attention goes it makes meaning/live for you/your attention but the stuff/things are neither live or dead, it is your attention who makes the stuff live/dead momently.

***Your attention works momently and hence it makes the stuff live/dead momently***
***The stuff exists momently in your attention since attention itself work momently***

Empty attention have very high value in human life but not that what get explained in above example. Empty attention means there is no any attention, in fact attention is empty for every things except the object/energy where attention is live/ steaming.

If any ways you vanish the ONE attention lightly then you get energy, in fact you will not get energy from any external source but you save the energy that get used by attention.

***Attention use much energy for running it***
***When you sleep your lost the attention and you realize fresh due to save the energy that get burned by attention*** 

If you want to observe how much energy you save during sleep(attention get lost automatically) then you should wake up full night and after noon you can realize what the value
/use the energy get saved during sleep in one night.

***Just wake up(run attention) 24 hours for observation***

How to makes SINLE attention EMPTY.
--------------------------------------------------
This is get done by either sleep or meditation. After sleep you save much energy but this is daily in usual process so you never realize. As sleep you save energy since your
attention not use any energy.

***Your life system have sufficient energy till your attention is running otherwise you automatically get die***
It is just like when kerosene get finished then your lamp can't lightning.

During meditation you also lost your attention and hence yourself during that time period and you save lot of energy and hence your feel relaxed.

***Sleeping is non active meditation and meditation is an active sleep***
***In meditation you get abundant energy where as in sleep you get limited energy***
