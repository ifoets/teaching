✅ Core Concepts & Architecture (1–20)
1.	What is RxJava and how does it work?
            RxJava is a Java implementation of Reactive Extensions (Rx) — a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences.
            It brings the concept of reactive programming to Java, allowing developers to build event-driven, non-blocking, and scalable applications.
            ________________________________________
            🔁 How It Works – Core Principles
            RxJava is built around three main components:
            Component	Role
            Observable	Emits a stream of data/events over time
            Observer	Subscribes to the Observable and reacts to the emitted data
            Operators	Transform, filter, merge, buffer, and control the stream of data
            The Observer subscribes to the Observable, and gets notified as data items are emitted. The stream can emit 0 or more items, complete, or error out.
            ________________________________________
            📥 Observable Types
            Each serves different use-cases:
            Type	Description
            Observable	Emits 0..n items; no backpressure support (Rx2/3)
            Flowable	Emits 0..n items; supports backpressure
            Single	Emits a single item or error
            Maybe	Emits one item, no item, or error
            Completable	Only success or error; no data

            🧵 Threading with Schedulers
            RxJava allows controlling threading via:
            Scheduler	Description
            Schedulers.io()	For I/O-bound tasks (disk, network, etc.)
            Schedulers.computation()	For CPU-heavy work (math, transformations)
            Schedulers.newThread()	Creates a new thread
            AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()	Android-specific UI thread
            ________________________________________
            🧠 Why Use RxJava?
            •	Elegant async handling (no callbacks)
            •	Declarative data stream transformation
            •	Thread control via schedulers
            •	Composition of multiple async sources
            •	Built-in support for error handling, retries, backpressure

2.	Difference between RxJava1, RxJava2, and RxJava3.
            Quick Visual Comparison
            Feature	                 RxJava1	                         RxJava2	                             RxJava3
            Stream Types	            Observable	            Observable, Flowable, Single, Maybe, Completable	        Same as RxJava2

3.	Explain Observable, Observer, and Subscriber.
            ✅ 1. Observable
            📌 Definition:
            An Observable is the source of data/events. It emits items (0 or more) over time.
            🧠 Think of it like:
            A YouTube channel that posts videos (data) — people can subscribe to it to watch (receive updates).
            🔧 Usage:
            java
            Observable<String> observable = Observable.just("RxJava", "is", "awesome");
            •	Emits a stream of three strings.
            ________________________________________
            ✅ 2. Observer
            📌 Definition:
            An Observer is the consumer that listens to the Observable, and reacts to:
            •	New data via onNext()
            •	Errors via onError()
            •	Completion via onComplete()
            🔧 Structure:

            ✅ 3. Subscriber (in RxJava1)
            📌 Definition:
            •	In RxJava1, Subscriber was an extension of Observer with added methods like unsubscribe() and support for backpressure.
            •	In RxJava2+, Subscriber is used with Flowable, not with Observable.
            java
            ⚠️ Use Observer for Observable, and Subscriber for Flowable.

            📌 Summary
            Term	             Role	                 RxJava Version
            Observable	  Emits data/events	             All versions
            Observer	Receives emitted data	         RxJava2, RxJava3
            Subscriber	Observer + backpressure ctrl	RxJava1 (legacy) + RxJava2 (Flowable)

4.	What are the different types of Observables?
            ✅ 1. Observable<T>
            📌 Definition:
            Emits 0 to many items, and then either completes or errors.
            •	No backpressure support (use Flowable for large data).
            •	Suitable for UI events, small lists, or short-lived tasks.
            🔧 Example:
            java
            Observable.just("A", "B", "C")
            📦 Emits:
            ✅ multiple values
            ✅ completes
            ✅ errors
            🧠 Analogy:
            Like a news feed where multiple posts are published over time.
            ________________________________________
            ✅ 2. Flowable<T>
            📌 Definition:
            Emits 0 to many items, just like Observable, but with backpressure support.
            •	Ideal for high-frequency data streams (e.g., sensor data, logs).
            •	Must request items using Subscription.request(n).
            🔧 Example:
            java
            Flowable.range(1, 1_000_000)
            📦 Emits:
            ✅ multiple values
            ✅ backpressure support
            ✅ completes / errors
            🧠 Analogy:
            Like a water pipe where pressure must be controlled to prevent overflow.
            ________________________________________
            ✅ 3. Single<T>
            📌 Definition:
            Emits exactly one item, or an error.
            •	Best for API calls, database fetches, or operations returning one result.
            🔧 Example:
            java
            Single.just("Login Successful")
            📦 Emits:
            ✅ one value
            ✅ or error only
            ❌ no multiple emissions
            🧠 Analogy:
            Like getting a single invoice from a payment gateway.
            ________________________________________
            ✅ 4. Maybe<T>
            📌 Definition:
            Emits zero or one item, or an error.
            •	Useful for optional values like "user may or may not exist".
            🔧 Example:
            java
            CopyEdit
            Maybe.just("Optional Value")
            or
            java
            CopyEdit
            Maybe.empty()
            📦 Emits:
            ✅ 0 or 1 value
            ✅ or error
            ❌ no multiple items
            🧠 Analogy:
            Like checking if a discount code is present or not.
            ________________________________________
            ✅ 5. Completable
            📌 Definition:
            Emits no data, only completion or error.
            •	Best for tasks where you only care about success/failure: saving a file, updating a DB.
            🔧 Example:
            java
            CopyEdit
            Completable.fromAction(() -> System.out.println("Saved to DB"))
            📦 Emits:
            ✅ Complete
            ✅ or error
            ❌ No data value
            🧠 Analogy:
            Like clicking "Save" — you don't expect data, just success/failure.

5.	What is backpressure and how is it handled in RxJava2?
            ✅ What is Backpressure in RxJava2?
            📌 Definition:
            Backpressure refers to a situation where the data producer (Observable) emits items faster than the consumer (Observer) can handle them, leading to potential memory overflow, CPU spikes, or crashes.

            🎯 Why Backpressure Matters
            In synchronous systems, speed mismatch is naturally balanced.

            In asynchronous/reactive systems, producers and consumers run on different threads, so the buffer may overflow if unchecked.

            📉 Problem Scenario (without backpressure):
            Observable.range(1, 1_000_000_000)
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribe(System.out::println);

            Producer emits 1 billion integers rapidly.
            Consumer (slow I/O thread) can't keep up.
            Memory fills up → OOM (OutOfMemoryError).

            ✅ How RxJava2 Handles Backpressure
            RxJava2 introduces a new type: Flowable<T>, specifically designed to handle backpressure.

            🔄 Core Idea:
            Backpressure-aware streams allow the consumer to request items at its own pace.

            🔧 Example with Flowable

            Flowable.range(1, 1_000_000)
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribe(new Subscriber<Integer>() {
                    private Subscription subscription;

                    @Override
                    public void onSubscribe(Subscription s) {
                        this.subscription = s;
                        subscription.request(100);  // Request 100 items
                    }
                });
6.	Explain the Observer Pattern and how RxJava uses it.
            ✅ What is the Observer Pattern, and How Does RxJava Use It?
            🔁 Observer Design Pattern — Core Idea
            The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where:
            An Observable (Subject) maintains a list of Observers (Subscribers).
            When the Observable’s state changes, it notifies all subscribed Observers.
            Promotes loose coupling between data producers and consumers.

            🧠 Real-World Analogy
            Imagine a newsletter service:
            The newsletter provider = Observable
            People who subscribe = Observers
            When the provider publishes a new article, all subscribers get it.

            🔧 Components of Observer Pattern
            Role	Description
            Subject (Observable)	Maintains a list of Observers and notifies them of changes
            Observer	Receives updates (notifications) from the Subject

            📦 How RxJava Implements the Observer Pattern
            In RxJava, the Observer Pattern is at the core of its reactive stream model.

            🔁 Mapping Traditional Pattern to RxJava
            Traditional Term	RxJava Equivalent
            Subject	Observable, Flowable
            Observer	Observer, Subscriber
            notifyObservers	onNext(), onError(), onComplete()
            registerObserver	.subscribe()

            ✅ RxJava Data Flow

            Observable<String> observable = Observable.just("Rx", "Java");

            Observer<String> observer = new Observer<>() {
                public void onNext(String item) {
                    System.out.println("Received: " + item);
                }

                   all others method
            };

            observable.subscribe(observer);
            📤 Emission Flow:
            onSubscribe() → called once when subscription starts

            onNext("Rx")
            onNext("Java")
            onComplete()

17.	Hot vs Cold Observables.
            🔥 Hot vs ❄️ Cold Observables in RxJava
            In RxJava, Observables are categorized based on when they start emitting items and how they behave for multiple subscribers:

            ❄️ Cold Observable
            📌 Definition:
            A Cold Observable starts emitting data only when a subscriber subscribes.
            Each subscriber gets its own independent data stream.

            🧠 Analogy:
            Like a YouTube video — each viewer (subscriber) watches the video from the beginning, independently of others.

            🔧 Characteristics:
            Property	Cold Observable
            Start time	When someone subscribes
            Emission per subscriber	Independent stream per subscriber
            Use case	Finite data (lists, APIs, files)
            Thread-safe	Usually yes
            Observable<Integer> cold = Observable.create(emitter -> {
                System.out.println("Emitting...");
                emitter.onNext(1);
                emitter.onNext(2);
                emitter.onComplete();
            });

            cold.subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Observer 1: " + i));
            cold.subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Observer 2: " + i));
            Output:

            Emitting...
            Observer 1: 1
            Observer 1: 2
            Emitting...
            Observer 2: 1
            Observer 2: 2
            🔥 Hot Observable
            📌 Definition:
            A Hot Observable starts emitting items immediately, even before anyone subscribes.
            Subscribers may miss previously emitted items.

            🧠 Analogy:
            Like a live webinar — if you join late, you miss what’s already been said.

            🔧 Characteristics:
            Property	Hot Observable
            Start time	Immediately or externally controlled
            Emission per subscriber	Shared among all
            Use case	Live data (mouse events, stock prices)
            Thread-safe	Depends (must handle concurrency)

            🔧 Example using PublishSubject:

            Subject<String> hot = PublishSubject.create();
            hot.subscribe(s -> System.out.println("Observer 1: " + s));
            hot.onNext("A");
            hot.onNext("B");
            hot.subscribe(s -> System.out.println("Observer 2: " + s));
            hot.onNext("C");
            Output:
            Observer 1: A
            Observer 1: B
            Observer 1: C
            Observer 2: C
            Observer 2 only sees "C" — it misses A and B since it subscribed late.



            🔄 Making Cold → Hot: Use publish().refCount()
            Observable<Long> hot = Observable
                .interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .publish()
                .refCount(); // converts cold to hot

8.	What is a Flowable? When should you use it?
            ✅ What is a Flowable in RxJava, and When Should You Use It?
            🔧 Definition:
            Flowable<T> is an Observable type in RxJava2+ that supports backpressure.
            It is designed for cases where:
            You emit large amounts of data
            The consumer might be slower than the producer
            You need fine control over data flow (like rate-limiting)

            🔁 Quick Comparison
            Type	Backpressure Support	Use Case
            Observable	❌ No	UI, small data sets, user inputs
            Flowable	✅ Yes	Large/fast streams, logs, I/O, sensors

            📤 Example: Creating a Flowable

            Flowable.range(1, 1_000_000)
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribe(
                    item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
                    Throwable::printStackTrace
                );
            This can handle millions of items without overflowing the consumer thread.

            🧠 Why Flowable?
            🔥 Problem with Observable:

            Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                .subscribe(System.out::println); // risk: emits too fast!
            Produces items every millisecond

            Consumer (slow println) can't keep up → OutOfMemoryError

            ✅ Solution: Use Flowable

            Flowable.interval(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                .onBackpressureDrop() // drop items when consumer lags
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribe(System.out::println);

9.	When would you choose Maybe vs Single vs Completable?
            ✅ When to Use Maybe vs Single vs Completable in RxJava
            In RxJava, these three types are specialized Observables that represent finite or optional emissions.

            They’re lightweight, and ideal when you don't need a full Observable or Flowable.

            🔍 Quick Summary Table
            Type	Emits	When to Use
            Single<T>	Exactly one item or error	Use when the operation always returns a value (e.g., API call, DB fetch)
            Maybe<T>	Zero or one item, or error	Use when the value might be present or not (e.g., optional DB lookup)
            Completable	No item, only complete or error	Use when you care only about completion, not the result (e.g., saving data)

            ✅ 1. Single<T>
            🔧 Emits:
            Exactly one item → onSuccess(T)
            Or an error → onError(Throwable)

            📌 Use When:
            Operation is guaranteed to return one value
            Failure should be reported clearly

            🧠 Example Use Cases:
            Network request for user profile
            Calculating a single result
            Reading a specific config from disk

            🔧 Code:
            Single<String> getUser() {
                return Single.just("John Doe");
            }
            ✅ 2. Maybe<T>
            🔧 Emits:
            Zero or one item → onSuccess(T) or onComplete()
            Or an error → onError(Throwable)

            📌 Use When:
            The result may or may not be present
            Optional values or nullable logic

            🧠 Example Use Cases:
            Optional DB record (user might not exist)
            Cache lookup (might be empty)
            Search result with limit 1

            🔧 Code:
            Maybe<String> findUserById(int id) {
                if (id == 1) return Maybe.just("Admin");
                else return Maybe.empty();
            }
            ✅ 3. Completable
            🔧 Emits:
            No value
            Only onComplete() or onError()

            📌 Use When:
            You don’t care about the return value, just success or failure
            For side-effects, like saving, deleting, writing

            🧠 Example Use Cases:
            Save/update record in DB
            Send email
            Logging action

            Completable saveToDb(String data) {
                return Completable.fromAction(() -> {
                    // Save logic
                    System.out.println("Saved: " + data);
                });
            }

10.	Difference between Observable and Flowable in RxJava2.
            ✅ Difference Between Observable and Flowable in RxJava2
            In RxJava2, both Observable and Flowable are used to emit streams of data over time, but they differ primarily in how they handle backpressure.

            🔁 1. Backpressure
            🔥 Observable:
            Push-based: emits items as fast as possible
            Cannot slow down for slow consumers
            ❌ If consumer is slow → OutOfMemoryError (OOM) possible

            💧 Flowable:
            Push-pull hybrid: producer waits for consumer request
            Complies with Reactive Streams spec
            Supports backpressure strategies (buffer, drop, latest, etc.)

            🔧 2. Code Comparison
            Observable (No backpressure):
            Observable.range(1, 1_000_000)
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribe(System.out::println); // ⚠️ Potential OOM

            Flowable (With backpressure):
            Flowable.range(1, 1_000_000)
                .onBackpressureBuffer()
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribe(System.out::println); // ✅ Controlled flow
            🔃 3. How to Convert
            Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.range(1, 1000);
            Flowable<Integer> flowable = observable.toFlowable(BackpressureStrategy.BUFFER);
            You must define a backpressure strategy when converting Observable → Flowable.
            🧠 Analogy
            Observable is like a firehose — water keeps coming no matter what.
            Flowable is like a tap with a valve — only releases water when you're ready.
11.	What is the role of the Disposable interface?
            📌 Definition:
            In RxJava, the Disposable interface represents a link between an Observable and an Observer.
            It allows the Observer to cancel (dispose) the subscription to stop receiving emissions and free up resources.

            🔧 Core Role:
            Manages lifecycle of a subscription.
            Releases memory/resources (like timers, threads, etc.) used by an Observable.
            Prevents memory leaks by disposing of observers when they’re no longer needed.

            🔁 Basic Workflow

            Observable<String> observable = Observable.just("A", "B", "C");
            Disposable disposable = observable.subscribe(
                item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item)
            );

            // Later, if no longer interested:
            disposable.dispose(); // Terminates the subscription

            You subscribe to a newsletter (subscribe()).
            When you’re done, you unsubscribe (dispose()), so you stop receiving emails and they stop wasting their effort on you.

            🔍 Key Methods in Disposable
            Method	Description
            dispose()	Terminates the subscription immediately
            isDisposed()	Checks whether it's already been disposed

            🧰 Common Use Cases
            ✅ 1. Disposing in Android (e.g., in Activity)
            Disposable disposable;

            @Override
            protected void onStart() {
                disposable = observable.subscribe(...);
            }

            @Override
            protected void onStop() {
                if (disposable != null && !disposable.isDisposed()) {
                    disposable.dispose();
                }
            }
            ✅ 2. Using CompositeDisposable
            If you have multiple Disposables, manage them in a CompositeDisposable:
            CompositeDisposable composite = new CompositeDisposable();

            composite.add(observable1.subscribe(...));
            composite.add(observable2.subscribe(...));

            composite.clear(); // Disposes all
12.	How does RxJava handle thread management internally?
            In RxJava, thread management is abstracted via the concept of Schedulers. These allow you to control where (on which thread)
             your Observable/Flowable code runs — both upstream (producer) and downstream (consumer).
            RxJava doesn’t use threads directly like new Thread() or Executors. Instead, it gives you a reactive and declarative way to manage concurrency.

            🔁 Key APIs
            Method	Purpose
            subscribeOn()	Tells RxJava which thread to use for producing (emitting) data
            observeOn()	Tells RxJava which thread to use for consuming (observing) data

            📦 Example:
            Observable.just("A", "B", "C")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())           // Producer runs on I/O thread
                .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())    // Consumer runs on computation thread
                .subscribe(item -> {
                    System.out.println("Received: " + item + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                });
            ⚙️ Internally, RxJava Uses:
            🔧 1. Scheduler Abstraction
            Each Scheduler manages a pool of worker threads behind the scenes.

            Scheduler Type	Use Case / Thread Pool
            Schedulers.io()	I/O-bound tasks (network, file) – cached thread pool
            Schedulers.computation()	CPU-bound tasks – fixed-size pool = #cores
            Schedulers.newThread()	Always creates a new thread
            Schedulers.single()	Single shared thread
            Schedulers.trampoline()	Runs tasks sequentially on the current thread, useful for testing or recursion
            AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()	Main UI thread (from RxAndroid)

            🔄 Thread Switching Internally
            Internally, when you use .subscribeOn() and .observeOn(), RxJava uses worker threads from thread pools and queues your work via Schedulers.

            Source → [subscribeOn() Thread] → Operators → [observeOn() Thread] → Observer
            For example:
            Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
                System.out.println("Emitting on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                return "data";
            })
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
            .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
            .subscribe(result ->
                System.out.println("Received on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName())
            );
            🧠 Thread Execution Model
            subscribeOn(): Affects the entire upstream (source + operators before observeOn).
            observeOn(): Affects the entire downstream (everything after it).
            You can chain multiple observeOn() to switch multiple times.

            🛠 Internal Scheduler Implementation (simplified)
            Under the hood:

            Each Scheduler creates a Worker, which is like a task executor.
            Workers use Java thread pools, like ScheduledExecutorService, ThreadFactory, and BlockingQueues.
            Flowable uses asynchronous fusion and backpressure-aware schedulers for performance and control.


13.	What are Schedulers? Explain different types.
            Schedulers are RxJava's abstraction for thread management — they decide where (on which thread) an Observable, Flowable, or
             other reactive stream should operate (emit or observe).

            Think of Schedulers as task executors that define the context (thread/pool) where the stream runs.

            🔧 Why Use Schedulers?
            Without Schedulers, RxJava runs everything on the current thread (synchronously).
            To make reactive streams truly asynchronous or parallel, we use Schedulers.

            🔑 Core APIs
            API	Purpose
            subscribeOn()	Sets the thread for source/emitter
            observeOn()	Sets the thread for observer/consumer

            🧪 Example:
            Observable.just("A", "B", "C")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())              // emit on I/O thread
                .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())       // consume on CPU thread
                .subscribe(item -> System.out.println(
                    "Received: " + item + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName()
                ));
            📦 Types of Schedulers in RxJava
            1. Schedulers.io()
            💡 Use: I/O-bound tasks (network calls, file read/write, DB)

            💻 Internally: Uses unbounded cached thread pool
            ✅ Best for: Multiple short-lived I/O tasks

            Observable.fromCallable(() -> downloadFile())
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io());
            2. Schedulers.computation()
            💡 Use: CPU-bound tasks (math, parsing, sorting)

            💻 Internally: Uses fixed thread pool = number of processors
            ⚠️ Avoid I/O here — it's optimized for computation-only

            Observable.just("1,2,3")
                .map(this::parseCSV)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation());
            3. Schedulers.newThread()
            💡 Use: Each task on a new thread

            ⚠️ Heavy on memory — not recommended for high-volume tasks
            ✅ Use only for fire-and-forget operations

            Observable.just("Run this")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread());
            4. Schedulers.single()
            💡 Use: Sequential background tasks
            💻 Internally: Uses a single-threaded executor
            ✅ Great for operations that need order

            Observable.range(1, 5)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.single());
            5. Schedulers.trampoline()
            💡 Use: Queues tasks on the current thread
            Tasks run sequentially, one after the other
            ✅ Useful for testing or recursive operations

            Observable.just("A", "B")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.trampoline());
            6. AndroidSchedulers.mainThread() (from RxAndroid)
            💡 Use: Run code on the main UI thread

            ✅ Required for updating UI elements in Android apps
            observable.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());

            🧠 Analogy
            Think of Schedulers like different delivery services:

            io() is like Swiggy Genie — runs many pickups at once
            computation() is like a math tutor working on CPU tasks
            single() is like a serial queue — one job at a time
            mainThread() is like the UI painter in Android — everything must go through them
14.	Explain the subscribeOn and observeOn difference.
            Both subscribeOn() and observeOn() are key RxJava operators used to control threading, but they affect different parts of the reactive chain.
            🧪 Example

            Observable.just("A", "B", "C")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())           // ⬅ Emission thread
                .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())    // ⬅ Observation thread
                .map(item -> item + "-processed")
                .observeOn(Schedulers.newThread())      // ⬅ Switch again
                .subscribe(item ->
                    System.out.println("Received: " + item + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName())
                );
            📌 subscribeOn(Scheduler scheduler)
            Sets the thread where the Observable starts emitting data.
            Only affects the upstream (everything before it).
            Only the first subscribeOn() call is effective — others are ignored.

            🔧 Example:
            Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
                System.out.println("Running on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                return "Result";
            })
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())  // Thread: I/O
            .subscribe();
            📌 observeOn(Scheduler scheduler)
            Changes the thread where the observer consumes the data.
            Affects the downstream (everything after it).
            You can call observeOn() multiple times to switch between threads.

            🔧 Example:
            Observable.just("Data")
                .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
                .map(data -> {
                    System.out.println("Mapped on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                    return data;
                })
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribe(result -> System.out.println("Observed on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));

            🧠 Analogy
            subscribeOn() = deciding where the chef cooks the food
            observeOn() = deciding which waiter serves it and where it’s eaten

            ✅ Best Practices
            Always use subscribeOn() for I/O-heavy tasks
            Use observeOn() when switching to main thread/UI or heavy computation
            Combine both for full control over emission and observation threads

15.	Difference between defer and fromCallable.
            Both Observable.defer() and Observable.fromCallable() are used to create Observables lazily, i.e., only when someone subscribes.
            However, they differ in how and when they create the emission logic.
            ✅ 1. Observable.fromCallable()
            📌 Use Case:
            You want to wrap a function that returns a single value (or throws) and emit it lazily when subscribed.
            Observable<String> obs = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
                System.out.println("Callable executed");
                return "Result";
            });

            obs.subscribe(System.out::println);  // Triggers callable
            🔁 Behavior:
            Callable is invoked only once per subscription
            Good for static or one-time delayed tasks

            ✅ 2. Observable.defer()
            📌 Use Case:
            You want to generate a new Observable every time a subscription happens (i.e., defer its creation).
            Observable<String> obs = Observable.defer(() -> {
                System.out.println("Creating new Observable");
                return Observable.just("Dynamic Value: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
            });

            obs.subscribe(System.out::println); // fresh time
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            obs.subscribe(System.out::println); // new fresh time
            🔁 Behavior:
            Executes the lambda each time someone subscribes

            Great when the emitted data is time-sensitive or stateful
            🧪 Key Example (Why defer() is powerful)
            Observable<Long> timeWrong = Observable.just(System.currentTimeMillis());
            Observable<Long> timeCorrect = Observable.defer(() -> Observable.just(System.currentTimeMillis()));

            timeWrong.subscribe(System.out::println); // Same value
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            timeWrong.subscribe(System.out::println); // Same value

            timeCorrect.subscribe(System.out::println); // Different value
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            timeCorrect.subscribe(System.out::println); // Different value

16.	How to avoid memory leaks in RxJava?
            Memory leaks in RxJava often occur when subscriptions outlive their context, such as an Activity, Fragment, or component
            that’s already destroyed — but the stream is still active.
            To avoid these leaks, you must properly manage Disposables and understand how lifecycle + threading interact with RxJava.

            🚨 Common Memory Leak Scenario
            disposable = Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(item -> textView.setText("Tick: " + item));
            // ❌ If you don’t dispose, this keeps running even after screen is gone!
            🛡️ Best Practices to Avoid Memory Leaks in RxJava
            ✅ 1. Always Dispose Subscriptions
            Use Disposable or CompositeDisposable to dispose streams when your component (e.g., Activity) is no longer active.
            CompositeDisposable composite = new CompositeDisposable();

            @Override
            protected void onStart() {
                Disposable d = someObservable.subscribe(...);
                composite.add(d);
            }

            @Override
            protected void onStop() {
                composite.clear(); // Disposes all
            }
            ✅ 2. Use Lifecycle-Aware Operators (on Android)
            If you're using Android, use AutoDispose, RxLifecycle, or LiveData to bind streams to component lifecycle:
            someObservable
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .to(autoDisposable(AndroidLifecycleScopeProvider.from(lifecycle)))
                .subscribe(...);
            Or use:
            someObservable
                .takeUntil(lifecycleEventObservable)
                .subscribe(...);
            ✅ 3. Avoid Anonymous Inner Class Captures
            Java lambdas or inner classes can capture references to Activity, Context, or View.
            Observable.timer(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .subscribe(aLong -> textView.setText("Updated"));
            // ❌ textView reference is captured and retained
            ⛔ Avoid long-lived subscriptions holding UI references.

            ✅ 4. Unsubscribe on Thread Switch (if needed)
            If you’re switching threads, especially from IO → mainThread, make sure to unsubscribe on the right thread using unsubscribeOn():
            observable
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .unsubscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) // dispose happens on I/O thread
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(...);
            ✅ 5. Use Weak References (as a last resort)
            You can use WeakReference<Context> or getApplicationContext() for passive contexts, especially in utilities or helpers.
            But it's better to manage lifecycles than to rely on weak references.

17.	Can an Observable emit an error and data both?
            🔴 No — an Observable cannot emit both data and an error.
            Once an Observable emits an error via onError(Throwable), it terminates and cannot emit any further items, including data or completion.

            📦 Reactive Contract (Observer Pattern)
            An Observable has a strict contract for terminal events:

            onNext(T) — Emits data (can be multiple)
            Then either:
            onComplete() ✅ — Normal completion
            onError(Throwable) ❌ — Abnormal termination
            Once either onComplete() or onError() is called, nothing else can be emitted.

            🧪 Example — ❌ Invalid Scenario
            Observable.create(emitter -> {
                emitter.onNext("A");
                emitter.onError(new RuntimeException("Oops"));
                emitter.onNext("B"); // ❌ Ignored — will never be called
            });
            Output:
            css
            Copy
            Edit
            A
            Error: Oops
            "B" is never emitted

            Once onError() is called, the stream is done

            ✅ Correct Ways to Handle Both Error and Data
            If you want to emit both data and error-like information, you must:

            ✅ 1. Wrap result in a container (Result, Either, etc.)
            Observable.just(Result.success("Data"), Result.failure(new Exception("Err")))
            Define a wrapper:
            sealed class Result<T> {
                static <T> Result<T> success(T data) { ... }
                static <T> Result<T> failure(Throwable error) { ... }
            }
            This way, error is part of the data stream, not a terminal event.

            ✅ 2. Use onErrorResumeNext() or onErrorReturn()
            You can recover from an error and continue emitting:
            Observable.just("A", "B")
                .concatWith(Observable.error(new RuntimeException("Crash")))
                .onErrorReturnItem("Recovered")
                .subscribe(System.out::println);
            Output:
            css
            A
            B
            Recovered
            But even here, Rx transforms the error into a valid data item to continue.

18.	Explain chaining of operators in RxJava.
            Operator chaining in RxJava is the process of applying a sequence of transformations and actions to a stream of data —
             using operators like map(), filter(), flatMap(), etc.
            RxJava allows you to build reactive pipelines in a declarative and functional way.

            📦 What Does "Chaining" Mean?
            You chain operators by calling them one after the other on an Observable, Flowable, or other reactive type.
            Each operator returns a new stream, allowing you to keep building the pipeline.

            🔁 Example: Chained RxJava Stream
            Observable.just("  hello ", "WORLD  ", " RxJava ")
                .map(String::trim)
                .map(String::toLowerCase)
                .filter(s -> s.length() > 4)
                .subscribe(System.out::println);
            📋 Output:
            hello
            world
            rxjava
            🔍 What Happened:
            just(...): Starts the stream with 3 strings.
            map(trim): Removes whitespace.
            map(toLowerCase): Converts to lowercase.
            filter(...): Removes short strings.
            subscribe(...): Consumes the final result.
            🧠 Chaining = Data Pipeline
            Think of chaining as building a data processing pipeline:
            Source → map() → filter() → flatMap() → observeOn() → subscribe()
            Each stage transforms or filters the data as it flows through.

            🎯 Why Chaining Is Powerful
            Clean, declarative logic
            Thread-safe and async-ready
            Composable — you can build reusable pieces
            Works great with immutability and pure functions
19.	What is cold start in RxJava context?
            ✅ Meaning 1: Cold Observable Behavior (Cold Start)
            A Cold Observable is one that starts emitting items only when an Observer subscribes, and restarts the stream for every new subscriber — this is often referred to as a cold start.

            🧪 Example:
            Observable<Long> coldObservable = Observable.fromCallable(() -> {
                System.out.println("Cold emission at: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
                return System.currentTimeMillis();
            });
            coldObservable.subscribe(val -> System.out.println("Observer1: " + val));
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            coldObservable.subscribe(val -> System.out.println("Observer2: " + val));
            📋 Output:
            Cold emission at: 1620000000001
            Observer1: 1620000000001

            Cold emission at: 1620000001001
            Observer2: 1620000001001
            🔍 Explanation:
            Each subscription restarts the stream.
            Cold start happens on every .subscribe() — hence, the observable is cold.

            ✅ Meaning 2: Startup Overhead (Performance Cold Start)
            In performance-sensitive applications (e.g., Android), a cold start might refer to the initial delay when setting
             up or executing a reactive stream, especially if it involves:
            Expensive source creation (e.g., DB connection)
            Heavy operator chains
            Lazy evaluation (e.g., defer(), fromCallable())
            Thread switching and scheduling overhead

            🧠 Example: Using .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) introduces a thread switch → cold startup delay.
            Observable.fromCallable(() -> loadDataFromDisk())
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(...);
            Here, the cold start is the delay until the first item is emitted, due to I/O or thread pool allocation.
20.	How do you handle resource cleanup in RxJava?
            ✅ How Do You Handle Resource Cleanup in RxJava?
            Resource cleanup in RxJava is critical to prevent:
            🧠 Memory leaks
            🧵 Thread exhaustion
            🔒 Open connections/sockets not released

            RxJava provides several tools and patterns to clean up resources automatically or explicitly,
            especially when a stream is disposed, completed, or fails.

            🧰 Key Approaches for Resource Cleanup
            ✅ 1. Using Disposable or CompositeDisposable
            When you subscribe to a stream, you receive a Disposable:
            Disposable disposable = Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .subscribe(item -> System.out.println("Item: " + item));

            // Cleanup when done:
            disposable.dispose();
            If you manage multiple streams:
            CompositeDisposable disposables = new CompositeDisposable();
            disposables.add(disposable1);
            disposables.add(disposable2);
            disposables.clear(); // Disposes all
            ✅ 2. doOnDispose() – Cleanup on Manual Dispose
            Run custom cleanup logic when stream is disposed:
            Observable<Long> observable = Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .doOnDispose(() -> System.out.println("Disposed. Clean up resources."));

            Disposable d = observable.subscribe();
            Thread.sleep(3000);
            d.dispose(); // Triggers doOnDispose()
            ✅ 3. doFinally() – Cleanup on Complete, Error, or Dispose
            doFinally() always runs — whether the stream completes, errors, or is disposed.
            Observable<String> observable = Observable.just("A", "B")
                .doFinally(() -> System.out.println("Cleaning up regardless of outcome"));

            observable.subscribe(
                item -> System.out.println("Item: " + item),
                Throwable::printStackTrace
            );
            ✅ Useful for closing:
            File handles
            DB connections
            Temporary locks

            ✅ 4. using() – Resource Lifecycle Binding
            Perfect for managing short-lived resources like streams, connections, etc.
            Observable<String> observable = Observable.using(
                () -> new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt")), // Resource supplier
                reader -> Observable.fromIterable(() -> reader.lines().iterator()), // Stream
                reader -> reader.close() // Cleanup
            );
            Automatically disposes the resource when:
            Observable completes
            Emits error
            Is disposed manually

            ✅ 5. takeUntil() – Auto-cleanup Based on Lifecycle Signal
            Observable<Long> observable = Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .takeUntil(stopSignalObservable); // Automatically disposes when signal comes
            ✅ Especially useful in Android when you want to auto-stop on onPause(), etc.

🧪 Operators (21–50)
21.	Explain map() vs flatMap().
            Both map() and flatMap() are transformation operators in RxJava, but they serve different purposes
            and behave differently — especially when dealing with asynchronous or nested streams.

            ✅ map() – One-to-One Transformation
            Used when you want to transform each emitted item into another form.
            Output of map() is not an Observable, just a value.

            📦 Example:
            Observable.just("a", "b", "c")
                .map(String::toUpperCase)
                .subscribe(System.out::println);
            🔹 Output:
            A
            B
            C
            ✅ flatMap() – One-to-Many / Async / Flattening
            Used when you need to transform an item into a new stream (Observable).
            Automatically flattens nested Observable<Observable<R>> into Observable<R>.

            📦 Example:
            Observable.just("user1", "user2")
                .flatMap(userId -> api.getUserDetails(userId)) // returns Observable<User>
                .subscribe(user -> System.out.println(user.getName()));
            🔹 Output:
            John
            Jane
            ✅ Great for:
            Network/database calls
            Merging multiple async results
            Returning nested Observables

            🧠 Visual Difference
            map():
            "item" → transformed item

            flatMap():
            "item" → Observable<sub-items> → flattened into stream
            🧪 Comparison Example
            Observable.just(1, 2, 3)
                .map(i -> Observable.just(i * 10))
                .subscribe(System.out::println); // ❌ Prints Observable

            Observable.just(1, 2, 3)
                .flatMap(i -> Observable.just(i * 10))
                .subscribe(System.out::println); // ✅ Prints values

22.	Difference between flatMap(), concatMap() and switchMap().
            These three operators — flatMap(), concatMap(), and switchMap() — all transform items emitted by a source Observable<T>
            into Observable<R>, then flatten the emissions into a single output stream.

            However, they differ significantly in:
            Execution order
            Concurrency
            Item switching behavior


            ✅ 1. flatMap() – Parallel & Unordered
            Starts all inner Observables immediately, concurrently.
            Does not guarantee the order of emissions.
            Observable.just(1, 2, 3)
                .flatMap(i -> getDataAsync(i))  // returns Observable<String>
                .subscribe(System.out::println);
            Useful for parallel tasks like API calls that don't depend on each other.

            ⚠️ Drawback:
            Results may arrive out of order, especially in asynchronous code.

            ✅ 2. concatMap() – Sequential & Ordered
            Queues and executes one inner Observable at a time.
            Preserves the order of emissions.
            Observable.just(1, 2, 3)
                .concatMap(i -> getDataAsync(i)) // returns Observable<String>
                .subscribe(System.out::println);
            Best when each item must complete before the next starts, e.g.:
            File writes
            Logging
            Chained API calls

            🕓 Slower, but safe for dependent logic.
            ✅ 3. switchMap() – Only Latest Survives
            Cancels any previous inner Observable when a new item arrives.
            Only the latest observable is active.
            Observable.create(emitter -> {
                emitter.onNext("query1");
                Thread.sleep(100);
                emitter.onNext("query2"); // query1 is cancelled
                Thread.sleep(100);
                emitter.onNext("query3"); // query2 is cancelled
            })
            .switchMap(query -> searchApi(query)) // returns Observable<String>
            .subscribe(System.out::println);
            Ideal for:

            Live search/autocomplete
            Canceling previous requests in UI
            Text input debouncing

            🔁 Visual Behavior
            flatMap()
            mathematica
            Input:    A    B    C
            Start:    A↘  B↘  C↘ (parallel)
            Output:   B   A   C (unordered)
            concatMap()
            Input:    A    B    C
            Start:    A↘  B↘  C↘ (sequential)
            Output:   A   B   C (in order)
            switchMap()
            mathematica
            Input:    A    B    C
            Start:    A↘ (cancel) B↘ (cancel) C↘
            Output:   C   (only latest)
