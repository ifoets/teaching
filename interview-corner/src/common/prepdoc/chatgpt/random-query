my system have 4 core how many virtual thread run concurrently efficiently
Can i gain benefit of time using virtual thread compared to normal java thread
parallelStream and virtual thread which is better to use
how to handle race condition by virtual thread

Parallel Streams in details

parallelism in stream and virtual thread use in two opposite first for CUP intensive and letter on network call db call , I am right\
    1. Use parallelStream() for CPU-Intensive Tasks/ logical computation
    2. Use Virtual Threads for I/O-Intensive Tasks / non logical computation
