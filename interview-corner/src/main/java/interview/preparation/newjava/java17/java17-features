     -5. New macOS Rendering Pipeline: enhance performance in masOs
     -6. Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals:.Java 17 strongly encapsulates JDK internals by default, making it harder to access and use internal APIs, promoting better security and stability.
     -7. Deprecation and Removal of Legacy Features:
      Java 17 deprecates the Applet API for removal in future versions, and also removes the RMI activation mechanism.


 -6. Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals:
How to Bypass (Not Recommended for Production)
If you must access internal APIs (e.g., for legacy reasons), use the following JVM flags:

Option 1: Use --add-exports to export a package to your code
--add-exports java.base/sun.misc=ALL-UNNAMED
Option 2: Use --add-opens to allow reflection
--add-opens java.base/sun.misc=ALL-UNNAMED
