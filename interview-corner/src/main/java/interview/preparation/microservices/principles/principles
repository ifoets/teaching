The principles used to design Microservices are as follows:

	1.	Independent & Autonomous Services
	2.	Scalability
	3.	Decentralization
	4.	Resilient Services
	5.	Real-Time Load Balancing
	6.	Availability
	7.	Continuous delivery through DevOps Integration
	8.	Seamless API Integration and Continuous Monitoring
	9.	Isolation from Failures //preventing a failure in one microservice from cascading and affecting other services, ensuring the overall system's resilience and reliability
	10.	Auto -Provisioning //automates the process of deploying and managing resources for microservices, including containers, infrastructure, and even user access
