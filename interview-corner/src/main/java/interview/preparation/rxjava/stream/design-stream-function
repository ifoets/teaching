Write a resilient Function<T, R> that can retry on transient errors and fall back to a default provider.

ðŸ”· 21â€“23: UnaryOperator<T>
Text Normalization Pipeline
Build a pipeline of UnaryOperator<String>s to clean, normalize, and validate user input.

Mathematical Function Chain
Compose multiple UnaryOperator<Double>s for numerical computation (e.g., normalize â†’ scale â†’ transform).

ðŸ”„ Bonus: Combine All
Workflow Engine: Design a mini-workflow engine where each step is a Function<T, R> or UnaryOperator<T>, executed conditionally using Predicate<T>, and outputs logged using Consumer<T>, with configuration loaded via Supplier<T>.
