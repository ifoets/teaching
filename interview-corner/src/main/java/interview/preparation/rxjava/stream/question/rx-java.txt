✅ 1–10: Core Stream Processing & Functional Interfaces
Group list of objects by a field and count frequency (Collectors.groupingBy, counting)
Flatten nested lists (List<List<T>>) into a single list
Find duplicate elements and their counts in a list
Partition data using partitioningBy with a complex condition
Custom Collector to accumulate results in a special data structure
Sort list of objects on multiple fields (using Comparator.comparing + .thenComparing)
Remove duplicates from custom object list (distinct() with equals and hashCode)
Convert a List<String> to a Map<Character, Long> representing character frequency
Filter list based on combined predicates (Predicate.and() / or() / negate())
Transform a list into a delimited string (like CSV) using Collectors.joining()

✅ 11–20: Advanced Mapping & Grouping
Convert a Map<K, List<V>> to Map<K, Set<V>> using Collectors.mapping
Create a Map<String, Integer> where key is name and value is total age from List<Student>
Count total even and odd numbers separately using partitioning
Extract top 3 highest-paid employees per department (nested grouping + sorting)
Merge two lists of objects by ID using Collectors.toMap with a merge function
From a list of sentences, generate a frequency map of all words
Create a histogram from a stream of integers (binning)
Flatten a map of map (e.g., Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>) into a flat stream
Transform a list of objects to a map of {field1 -> List<field2>} using grouping and mapping
Convert nested object structure (e.g., List<Employee> with List<Skill>) into Set<String> of unique skill names

✅ 21–30: Terminal Operations and Custom Collectors
Write a custom collector that collects a stream into a reversed list
Build your own implementation of Collectors.toMap
Sum and average salary of employees by department
Get the min/max/average age per city from a list of people
Find the second highest salary using streams
Implement Collectors.toUnmodifiableList() behavior manually
Implement a collector that partitions numbers into prime and non-prime
Create a streaming pipeline that counts vowels from a string list
Track the first non-repeating character in a stream of characters
From List<Transaction>, get total transaction amount by year & month

✅ 31–40: Parallel Streams & Performance
Parallel stream: sum of large array vs sequential – performance difference
Split large CSV file into chunks and process each in parallel with streams
When to avoid parallel streams? Give code example with performance issue
Process large directory and group files by extension using parallel stream
Handle thread-safety issues in parallel forEach with shared mutable state
Load data from file into stream and process line-by-line safely
Simulate CPU-intensive task with parallelStream and compare execution time
