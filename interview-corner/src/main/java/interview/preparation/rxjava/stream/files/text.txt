At some point in late July, Barack Obama picked up the phone and decided to do the very thing Barack Obama once promised never to do.
According to a report in Washington Post, the former president called Eric Holder.
They’d been pacing in moral circles for days, torn between the democracy they’d idealised and the democracy they’d inherited.
Donald Trump had just pulled off a mid-decade redistricting coup in Texas, adding five shiny new Republican House seats by the time-honoured MAGA method of brute force and zero shame.
It was the sort of thing that would once have prompted an Obama speech about “institutions,” “norms,” and “the long arc of justice.”
But now? He and Holder agreed that the arc was broken — and the only way to bend it back was with a crowbar.
So they backed Gavin Newsom’s California Proposition 50 — a mirror-image power grab that would add five Democratic-leaning seats to cancel out Trump’s Texas shuffle.
The poet laureate of bipartisanship had just joined the partisan brawl.
“We’re doing things that go against what we talked about,” Holder reporedtly said.
