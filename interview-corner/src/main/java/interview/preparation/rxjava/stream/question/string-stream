✅ Why These Are Perfect for Java 8 Stream Practice
•	They force use of core Stream APIs: map, filter, flatMap, collect, groupingBy, counting, sorted, distinct, reduce, peek, limit, skip, etc.
•	Many problems benefit from Collectors.groupingBy + Collectors.counting combo.
•	Several problems can be solved without loops using IntStream.range + substring logic.
•	Great for showing functional programming fluency in Java during interviews.

📌 Suggested Learning Path
Instead of solving all 100 at once, do this:
1.	Pick 10 from each category → total 60 high-value problems
2.	Solve each with Stream-only first, then compare with imperative loop solution
3.	Practice explaining your stream pipeline clearly (interviewers love clarity)
