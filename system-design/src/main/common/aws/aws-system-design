✅ Tip for interview prep:
    For each design question, always structure your response as:
    1.	Requirements → functional + non-functional.
    2.	High-level Architecture → diagram + service choice (EC2, ECS, Lambda, RDS, etc.).
    3.	Data flow & scaling → how traffic and load are handled.
    4.	Security → IAM, encryption, VPC, etc.
    5.	Monitoring & Cost Optimization → CloudWatch, autoscaling, lifecycle policies.
