✅ Functional Requirements (FRs)
1.	Multi-Channel Support
    o	Send notifications via Email, SMS, Push, In-App, and Webhooks.
2.	Message Templates
    o	Create, update, and store reusable templates.
    o	Support placeholders/variables (e.g., {{username}}, {{otp}}).
3.	Event Handling
    o	Receive events from producers (apps, services).
    o	Map events to notification types.
4.	User Preferences Management
    o	Allow users to opt-in/out of specific channels.
    o	Manage Do-Not-Disturb (DND) windows.
5.	Scheduling & Retry
    o	Schedule notifications (e.g., reminders).
    o	Retry failed deliveries (with exponential backoff).
    o	Fallback channels (if push fails → send SMS).
6.	Delivery Tracking & Status Updates
    o	Track states: Queued, Sent, Delivered, Failed, Read.
    o	Provide APIs for querying notification history.
7.	APIs & Integrations
    o	REST/GraphQL APIs to trigger notifications.
    o	Webhook support for third-party callbacks.
    o	SDKs for mobile/web integration.
8.	Multi-Tenancy (SaaS)
    o	Isolate data between tenants (companies).
    o	Support custom branding per tenant.
9.	Admin Dashboard
    o	Manage templates, channels, campaigns.
    o	Analytics on delivery, open rate, click rate.
10.	Security & Compliance
    •	Handle encryption of sensitive data (e.g., phone/email).
    •	Consent management (GDPR, HIPAA).

✅ Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
1.	Scalability
    o	Must handle millions of notifications/day.
    o	Horizontal scaling of workers/queues.
2.	Performance
    o	Low latency for critical notifications (e.g., OTP < 3s).
    o	Bulk notifications should be processed efficiently.
3.	Reliability
    o	Ensure at-least-once delivery.
    o	Guarantee ordering where necessary.
4.	Availability
    o	99.9% uptime SLA.
    o	Fault tolerance across regions/zones.
5.	Security
    o	Data encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS, AES-256).
    o	Role-based access control (RBAC).
    o	Audit logs.
6.	Maintainability
    o	Configurable templates without code changes.
    o	Clear monitoring & alerting.
7.	Observability
    o	Metrics: latency, throughput, error rates.
    o	Distributed tracing for event flow.
8.	Compliance
    o	GDPR (Right to Forget, Consent).
    o	CAN-SPAM, TCPA for SMS/email marketing.
9.	Cost Efficiency
    o	Optimize provider usage (choose cheapest route).
    o	Support for quota limits per tenant.
10.	Extensibility
    •	Easy to add new channels (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack).
    •	Pluggable provider architecture.

⚡In interviews, they usually expect you to call out both:
•	FRs → what the system must do.
•	NFRs → how well the system must perform.
