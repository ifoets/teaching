know length of sort url

Long URL to short URL
short URL to long url

what is traffic we looking at/how many unique url come to us for shorting every day/month and until what duration we need to support it

assumed
save next 10 year short url to long Url conversion
x- no of request/seconds
what is alphabet is allowed, a-z/A-Z/0-9 or whatever get used in short URL
What should be length or short URL(handle Y unique url having 62 chars)

X*60*60*24*365*10=Y for 10 year, ie system should handle these no of unique request
a-z + A-Z + 0-9 =62 alphabet

L-Char
1-62/2-Math.pow(62,2)...so on finally solve Math.pow(62,n)>Y
Math.pow(62,n)>Y, then n = log(bas 62)Y
62 to pow 6=56 Billion
62 to pow 7= 3.5 TRILLION
generally need to build 6 to 7 char short URL


Above building is functional and non functional requirement
Analytics, Matrix about how it get use, what most geography people use,IPs, Headers etc used by USER
use kafka/build bunch of queue and flush to kafka
HADOOP for dumb data
