data base design
==================
design and scale depends on use of database
db design not impact function requirement but it impact non functional requirement

which types of data need to store or certain types of scale to handle
design of db depends on couples of facter

amount of scale need to handle
having certain query pattern
/structured data/
/non structured data/
image or video in large amount
matrix types of data like grafana dashboard ie application matrix tracing system
analytic requirement data amazon/uber, analytic of all the transaction/orders/geography ie data warehouse ie large amount of data

cashing solution
cashing for multiple hit db or multiple hit remote server having more latency
key value store for caching
Redis cache or any similar caching


image or video in large amount
use blob storage this not db for query but for serving from storage
cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

for this use content delivery network (CDM) it is used to distribute same image/video to multiple servers
Amazon S3+CMD for image/video storage

text searching capabilities
-missing alphabet, bit typing mistake, alphabet gaping/edit distance
text search engine elastic search or solr/ Solr is more focused on text-based queries and Elasticsearch works towards analytical queries
Fuzzy search is a search technique that finds results that are similar to a search query, even if there are typos or misspelling

A time series database (TSDB) is a software system that stores and manages data that changes over time
sequential update up and down write mode/ normal dab having random update/access
read query on bulk in time range
open TSDB
Amazon Timestream
InfluxDB
Graphite


analytic requirement data /not used for transaction but offline reporting
hadoop

RDBMS/ACID or non ACID but structured-Mysql Oracle,Posgres
DOCUMENTS DB /non structured json, complex searching-Momgo Db/Cosmos
COLUMNAR DB/ever increasing data, uber location vehicle location search-Cassandra, Hbase
